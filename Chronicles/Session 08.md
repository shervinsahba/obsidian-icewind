# Chronicles
## The Moon Dial and Sahnar the Mummy
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose The party explored the Elven Tomb found in [[Lonelywood]] Forest. Several tall elven status surrounded the berm and central moon dial, and they buzzed with magic as [[Azgul]] investigated them.)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose A puzzle involving a brazier, magical glyphs, and a sealed sarcophagus was solved - with minimal injury to [[Fern]]'s scorched hand. A mummified priestess of Selune, goddess of the moon, arose from the granite and marble crypt.  The mummy did not appear hostile and spoke ancient Elvish, but [[Tetro]] managed to communicate with her using telepathy granted by the psi crystal. Her name was [[Sahnar]], and she is a guardian entity of the shrine. Her decayed form lacks much memory and cognition, but she seemed amenable to following the party's commands. Sahnar noted that the site has been descrated, but she sensed not why. [[Sahnar]] was wearing an ornate cloak in pristine condition, a magical contrast to her otherwise decayed wrappings.)
- (x:: A silvered Elvish magic mirror was found adhered in the full moon chamber of the Elvish Tomb. Fern asked about the golden light the party saw, and an avatar of Lathander responded that it was a man named Macreadus. Tetro asked about Auril's weakness, and an avatar of Mystra responded that the winter she casts takes a toll on her. Hazel asked about the white moose, and Malar god of the hunt jeered back that it's no moose, it stalks you, and the girl awakened it. Azgul asked about the Netherese Ruins, and Oghma responded that they remain buried below the ice. Crank asked if they were restoring balance to the Dale, and Auril's avatar responded that Icewind Dale is her domain to PRESERVE. Oona about the moose, and Mystra said it was quite an abomination. The old huntsman Clive asked about his granddaughter Ravisin, and Kelegor's avatar responded that he only has claim on the other.)
- NEED TO UPDATE THE THINGS! THIS IS INCOMPLETE!
