# Chronicles
## The Moon Dial and Sahnar the Mummy
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose The party explored the Elven Tomb found in [[Lonelywood]] Forest. Several tall elven status surrounded the berm and central moon dial, and they buzzed with magic as [[Azgul]] investigated them.)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose A puzzle involving a brazier, magical glyphs, and a sealed sarcophagus was solved - with minimal injury to [[Fern]]'s scorched hand. A mummified priestess of Selune, goddess of the moon, arose from the granite and marble crypt.  The mummy did not appear hostile and spoke ancient Elvish, but [[Tetro]] managed to communicate with her using telepathy granted by the psi crystal. Her name was [[Sahnar]], and she is a guardian entity of the shrine. Her decayed form lacks memory or much cognition, but she seemed amenable to following the party's commands. Sahnar noted that the site has been descrated, but she sensed not why. [[Sahnar]] was wearing an ornate cloak in pristine condition, a magical contrast to her otherwise decayed wrappings.)
