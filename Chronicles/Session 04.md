# Chronicles
##  Targos. 
- x:: The party started the day at Kelvin's Comfort.
- x:: #ArmoredCorps Knocking on the rear entrance of [[Bryn Shander#The Hooked Knucklehead]] caught the half-orc and Zhentarim ruffian [[Zarruk]] off-guard. Surrounded by the six party members, he fessed up that some stolen crates of shortsword, daggers, and light crossbows from [[Bryn Shander#Armory]] were still in his custody and due to head to [[Targos]]. The party wanted in on their transport. Intimidated by [[Fern]] and company and tithout another option, Zarruk complied, telling them to drop it off at the [[Targos#Luskan Arms]] for the usual remunerations.
- x:: #ArmoredCorps Half the stolen goods were restored to [[Markham Southwell]]'s control. [[Hazel Greenwater]] managed to persuide the sheriff to let them take the other half to the Zhentarim in [[Targos]] and act as double agents.
- x:: [[Azgul]] acquired scale mail from [[Markham Southwell]] for 50gp, trading in his chain shirt for 5gp as well.
- x:: Six sled dogs and a sled were rented for 20gp for the day's run to [[Targos]]. It is unclear if this rental will be honored. With the [[Bryn Shander#Stables]] keeper in a hurry, [[Crank]] noted they never left a deposit, after all.
- x:: Traveling between [[Bryn Shander]] towards [[Targos]], the party passed an ecstatic wailing woman, not dressed for winter on the side of the trail. With a fire cooking some form of meat.
- x:: #ArmoredCorps The party dropped off the crate for Zhentarim pickup in the shed at the rear of the [[Targos#Luskan Arms]]. The tavernkeeper, [[Owenn Tarsenal]], seems to turn a blind eye to these dealings. He paid the usual sum he is instructed to give, 60sp, alongside an evening's swill and meal, some fish sausage.
- x:: [[Azgul]] spoke with [[Owenn Tarsenal]] about happenings in [[Targos]]. The town conducts a [[blood sacrifice]] lottery on the new moon. The town speaker, [[Naerth Maxildannar]], and his council run it, and the militia captain [[Skath]] officiates the sacrifice to appease the goddess of winter's wrath. The lottery is conducted during the three days prior to the new moon with the militia controlling passage into the town during those days.
- x:: #ColdHeartedKiller The murder in [[Targos]] appeared to be a man who fled the results of the lottery.
- x:: #MountainClimb A dog, [[Boy]], got the attention of the party and dragged them to the house of [[Keegan Velryn]], a schrimshander and former mountaineer. His husband [[Garret Velryn]] was a mountain guide and had led a small expedition to [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Boy never leaves his master's side unless there is trouble. At Keegan's request (and a promise of free rooms at the [[Targos#Luskan Arms]] through his friend [[Owenn Tarsenal]]), the party decided they would go on a rescue mission for Garret and company, traveling up through [[Termalaine]].

## Termalaine. 
- x:: Arriving at the dark of early evening, the party found lodging at [[Termalaine#The Eastlook]]. The innkeeper, a teenage girl named [[Marta Pekryk]], who tends to the inn ever since her father took ill, had been softly singing the following verse: *Ahead of winter’s wind she came / The lovely woman with no name; / Draped in a fur-lined cloak of red / To the icy lake she fled; / The wind pursued her all the same / As sure as night she’s dead.* This song was a legend about a forlorn traveler who gifted a ring of warmth to her grandparents. The traveler died the next day when she departed. Marta wears the ring, and it seems to bring her comfort. ![[ring_of_warmth.png | 250]]
- x:: #ABeautifulMine Miners had been returning back from work in [[Termalaine]]. A boy on a soapbox was announcing that a monster infestation in a gem mine 
- x:: The party visited [[Termalaine#The Blue Clam]], the harborside tavern,
