# Chronicles
## The Black Cabin
- (x:: The party spent the morning in [[Lonelywood]], picking up rumors and reading the [[Ten Towns Times]]. They wondered whether to pick up some coin in [[Bremen]], where sighting of a lake monster in [[Maer Dualdon]] had scared off fishermen. They considered the tale of missing sailors bear [[Lac Dinneshere]], and recalled that [[Easthaven]] is also where [[Vellyne Harpell]] had set off, hearing that [[Dzaan]] had fell into misfortune. There was still a killer on the loose, too. Ultimately, the party couldn't shake the golden burst of light they had seen from the mountaintop several days ago, and felt that this was the road they needed to travel.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The party mulled over their leads at the [[Lonelywood#Lucky Liar| Lucky Liar]]. From atop [[Kelvin's Cairn]], they had seen a burst of golden, warm light coming from the forests of [[Lonelywood]]. On talking to townsfolk, they learned that while some old hunting cabins are out there, nobody seems to really live there, yet [[Perilou]] knew of a gnome named [[Copper]] who lived in the temple at [[Bryn Shander]]. Copper spoke of a former friend, a sage of sorts, who took to hermitage in the outskirts of Lonelywood. One ole crone hinted at a [[Black Cabin]], a haunted place overlooking the forests.) 
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn Overhearing the conversation, the sly, every-knowing tavernkeep of the Lucky Liar, [[Danae Xotal]], said she knew of the mage who lived out there... and hinted that the old fool was probably dead out there anyway. The mage had used Arcane Brotherhood networks to get a #SpecialDelivery several weeks ago. Danae likes to keep track of such things. Intimidated by [[Azgul]], Danae relented and gave them guidance to follow the ridge around [[Maer Dualdon]] and keep an eye out for the [[Black Cabin]] overhanging the cliffside.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The [[Black Cabin]] was a dilapidated, abandoned structure on 20 foot stilts, creaking and groaning in the wind. A soft, thick snow had blanketed the area, removing all sight of tracks, but some lush vegetation and greenery appeared to be present in a close radius to the cabin. [[Tetro]] and [[Fern]] assessed the integrity of the building, finding some weak stairs and flooring, so [[Fern]] shattered a window and [[Hazel]] led the way, light-footed, to secure a rope and passage to the interior for [[Crank]]. In the meantime, [[Oona]] and [[Tetro]] looked through what seemed to be a workshop with *smith's tools* and *tinkerer's tools*. [[Oona]] decided to enter the main area by lumberjacking through a wall. The cabin shook as her axe parted the thin walls.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn Inside the main room of the [[Black Cabin]], all the furniture was blackened with ash. There were broken wine bottles, a charred book, a burnt skeleton of a human male, and a six inch diameter device: two concentric rings with a black stone inside. While [[Azgul]] used magic to look over some of the runes, ancient ones in a forgotten Giant tongue, drawings of which were in the workshop, [[Tetro]] picked up the device. He gazed into it as it illuminated. Looking steadfastly as the light grew in intensity, a radiant burst enveloped the party. When the dust settled, all that left of poor [[Tetro]] was ash.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The party, stunned by [[Tetro]]'s apparent demise, resolved to uncover the mysteries of the [[Black Cabin]] to piece together what went wrong. [[Oona]] swept some turtle ash into a leather pouch as a remembrance. The party split up, discovering blueprints of what is called a *Summer Star*, a reproduction of an ancient Netherese device to control the weather. There were scrawlings of runic designs for the device, many iterations - the work of a madman obsessed. They read through scroll sent to the man, confirmed to be [[Macreadus]], sent by [[Copper]]. The note detailed Macreadus's maddening obsession as well as Copper's opinion that the device required *three* for stability, not *two*.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn As the party pieced together clues in the [[Black Cabin]], strange occurrences occurred. Loud knocks, three in a row, would bang as characters interacted with the items of the house. A rug would shift, revealing more runic patterns and designs. Tools would fall off tables, and Copper's letter, in the hands of [[Crank]] began to tug him in different directions, like a dowsing rod. Not all the spectral happenings seemed to encourage them, a bottle of wine [[Fern]] found was nearly tugged from her grasp. [[Oona]] was fed up, smashing her axe into the cabin in a rage. Nevertheless, the party uncovered that they needed to forge a third ring, etch it with the appropriate runes, and reconstruct the *Summer Star*. With [[Crank]] smelting a new ring and [[Fern]] forging the runes under [[Azgul]]'s guidance, they pieced it together. The device seemed to roll at them, begging to be touched. 
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn [[Hazel]] picked up the *Summer Star* and attuned to the orb, as the same radiance began to fill the room. Some party members ran for cover. But their work had
