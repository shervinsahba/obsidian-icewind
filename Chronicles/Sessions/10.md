# Chronicles
## The Black Cabin
- (x:: The party spent the morning in [[Lonelywood]], picking up rumors and reading the [[Ten Towns Times]]. They wondered whether to pick up some coin in [[Bremen]], where sighting of a lake monster in [[Maer Dualdon]] had scared off fishermen. They considered the tale of missing sailors bear [[Lac Dinneshere]], and recalled that [[Easthaven]] is also where [[Vellyne Harpell]] had set off, hearing that [[Dzaan]] had fell into misfortune. There was still a killer on the loose, too. Ultimately, the party couldn't shake the golden burst of light they had seen from the mountaintop several days ago, and felt that this was the road they needed to travel.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The party mulled over their leads at the [[Lonelywood#Lucky Liar| Lucky Liar]]. From atop [[Kelvin's Cairn]], they had seen a burst of golden, warm light coming from the forests of [[Lonelywood]]. On talking to townsfolk, they learned that while some old hunting cabins are out there, nobody seems to really live there, yet [[Perilou]] knew of a gnome named [[Copper]] who lived in the temple at [[Bryn Shander]]. Copper spoke of a former friend, a sage of sorts, who took to hermitage in the outskirts of Lonelywood. One ole crone hinted at a [[Black Cabin]], a haunted place overlooking the forests.) 
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn Overhearing the conversation, the sly, every-knowing tavernkeep of the Lucky Liar, [[Danae Xotal]], said she knew of the mage who lived out there... and hinted that the old fool was probably dead out there anyway. The mage had used Arcane Brotherhood networks to get a #SpecialDelivery several weeks ago. Danae likes to keep track of such things. Intimidated by [[Azgul]], Danae relented and gave them guidance to follow the ridge around [[Maer Dualdon]] and keep an eye out for the [[Black Cabin]] overhanging the cliffside.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The [[Black Cabin]] was a dilapidated, abandoned structure on 20 foot stilts, creaking and groaning in the wind. A soft, thick snow had blanketed the area, removing all sight of tracks, but some lush vegetation and greenery appeared to be present in a close radius to the cabin. [[Tetro]] and [[Fern]] assessed the integrity of the building, finding some weak stairs and flooring, so [[Fern]] shattered a window and [[Hazel]] led the way, light-footed, to secure a rope and passage to the interior for [[Crank]]. In the meantime, [[Oona]] and [[Tetro]] looked through what seemed to be a workshop with *tinkerer's tools*)
