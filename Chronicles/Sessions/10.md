## The Black Cabin
- The party spent the morning in [[Lonelywood]], picking up rumors and reading the [[Ten Towns Times]]. They wondered whether to pick up some coin in [[Bremen]], where sighting of a #LakeMonster in [[Maer Dualdon]] had scared off fishermen. They considered the tale of missing sailors bear [[Lac Dinneshere]], and recalled that [[Easthaven]] is also where [[Vellyne Harpell]] had set off, hearing that [[Dzaan]] had fell into misfortune. There was also a #ColdHeartedKiller on the loose. Ultimately, the party couldn't shake the golden burst of light they had seen from the mountaintop several days ago, and felt that this was the road they needed to travel.
