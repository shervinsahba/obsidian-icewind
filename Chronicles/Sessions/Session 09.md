# Chronicles
## Of Ravisin and Vurnis.

- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose A dying [[Ravisin]] seemed pleased with her fate. She explained her malcontent with the Dalefolk for the mistreatment of her sister [[Vurnis]], which [[Old Huntsman Clive]] later expressed was most likely her rape. [[Vurnis]] was a [[Midwinter Child]], a blessed girl and the fairer of the two sisters. She had left [[Lonelywood]] months ago to seek her destiny only to meet mistreatment. She turned to the cult of [[Auril]], becoming a frost druid. Ravisin in her youth was the less fortunate of the sisters: lesser in wits, achievement, and charms. She followed Vurnis everywhere, and thus followed her sister into a radicalized worship of the Frostmaiden.)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose [[Vurnis]]'s body laid peacefully atop a closed [[Elven Tomb]] sarcophagus, surrounded by four druidic rune stones and clutching a crystal of raw ice. On investigation, [[Fern]] noticed Vurnis's throat had been cut and deduced it to be the cause of death, seeing no other markings. The wound must have occurred within the past two moons. While there were ligature marks along the bottom of the body, there was no frost nor evidence of the cold affecting her vitreous humors. Looking at the runes, [[Hazel]] recognized them from markings on local shrines of offering she had passed by in Ten Towns. [[Azful]] recalled from his studies that the runes stood for [[Auril]]'s four tenets: *Isolation, Cruelty, Endurance, and Preservation.*)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose The northern half moon tomb also contained a rack of drying herbs and charcoal the druid had been utilizing, from which [[Fern]] took enough samples to use for a future Find Familiar summoning. There was also an **awakened shrub** that the party named [[Joey the Shrub]]. It was terrified, both of [[Ravisin]] and of being sentient, and it had some tasty berries. The shrub told of how Ravisin had traveled around the lakes and forest of Ten Towns awakening animals to do her bidding. The white moose is one of these creatures, though it eventually took a far more frightening form. Ravisin blamed the powers of the [[Elven Tomb]] or the elvish banshees of the forest for this. [[Tetro]] tried to convince Shrub Joey to climb on his back, but the shrub was too overwhelmed to accept.)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose When queried, [[Sahnar]] suggested they bury any new dead and return any other dead to their crypts. [[Hazel]] accompanied [[Old Huntsman Clive]] and put the two sisters to rest with her trusty halfling shovel. Some time later, [[Joey the Shrub]] was planted near them to stay in the light of the forest.)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose The southern half moon tomb contained an opened sarcophagus with two elven skeletons inside. Inside were a hunting horn and a silvered arrowheads. [[Azgul]] picked up the horn, discerning it to be magical, while [[Tetro]] objected but ultimately let Azgul proceed. After a short rest, [[Azgul]] realized the wondrous object was a **Horn of Silent Alarm**, though he refrained from using it yet.)

## The White Moose Hunts.

- (x:: #battle #TheWhiteMoose A thick fog began to blanket the area, and sounds of a moose were heard in the distance. The party bunkered in the tomb for a quick rest, but then heard the *pwah!* noise of [[Chwinga]]. Slowly scouting the perimeter with [[Hazel]] keeping watching from atop the gnomon and [[Azgul]] stepping towards the southern forest, more voices began appearing: those of hunters in need for instance. Sensing a presence behind one of the tall elvish statues, [[Azgul]] Eldritch Blasted through it revealing a wendigo horror. The battle was one of light and shadow with the wendigo suddenly shifting between trees and behind bodies in the dimness of the fog as [[Tetro]] and [[Hazel]] lit up the grounds with spellfire and [[Fern]] cloaking herself in the occlusion of the twilight to strike. The party wrecked the distorted moose, which shriveled to its former form.)
- (x:: #TheWhiteMoose The party made their way back to [[Lonelywood]], parting ways for [[Old Huntsman Clive]] and lodging at [[Nimsy Huddle]]'s residence well past midnight. Each party member earned **13 gold** for their efforts in the end, as well as a sled full of moose flesh.)
