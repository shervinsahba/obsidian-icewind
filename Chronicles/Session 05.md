# Chronicles
##  Ascent to the Yeti's Den
- (x:: #MountainClimb Having rescued [[Garret Velryn]], the party continued up [[Kelvin's Cairn]] seeking the remaining three members of Garret's party.)
- (x:: #MountainClimb [[Garret Velryn]] was guiding three individuals, a goliath man [[Mokingo Growling Bear]] who was in search of a legendary beast, the Winter Walker [[Oyaminatorok]], a lightfoot halfling acolyte woman [[Perilou]], and a brooding, tight-lipped Tiefling woman[[Astrix]].)
- (x:: #MountainClimb The party approached a yeti den, seeking the adult male yeti that attacked [[Garret Velryn]] and company. Finding blood and several large but muddled footprints, they snuck into a cave, where they found the eviscerated torso of [[Mokingo Growling Bear]] in a crude trophy room. Two other severed heads could be well-discerned, one belonging to [[Oobok]] and the other belonging to a red-haired shield dwarf.)
- (x:: #battle #MountainClimb In the darkness, they found a yeti and... something else. The party took the opportunity to attack the beast and lure it out. In the following confusion, they realize a yeti tyke had been batting around [[Perilou]], exhausted but unharmed, and that they were fighting the mother. As they dispatched the monstrosity, the father approached, continuing the battle.)
