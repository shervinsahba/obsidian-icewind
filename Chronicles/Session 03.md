# Chronicles
## Of Iron and Snow

- (x:: #battle #ArmoredCorps The party fought four [[Zhentarim]] thugs in a Bryn Shander alley. They got one to talk after they discovered a [[Bryn Shander#The Hooked Knucklehead]] tavern flyer on him with a note `...-.-..` on the back. It was a knocking passcode for the backdoor of the tavern, where the Zhentarim have been fencing stolen goods from the armory.)
- (x:: #FrostedMugs Dogs and sleds were rented from [[Bryn Shander#Stables]] for 30g to set out towards the tundra towards the Dwarven Valley to find the missing iron ingots belonging to [[Hruna]] and the remaining Foamings Mugs dwarves.)
- (x:: #battle #FrostedMugs Six goblins, a goblin boss, his pet hawk, and two wagon-laden polar bear were encountered. Two potions of animal friendship, a bone whistle, and 50s were found afterwards. The polar bears were set free by [[Tetro]]. The hawk was charmed by [[Crank]] and later sold to [[Hruna]] for 5g.)
- (x:: #battle Camping in a cave, [[Tetro]] was ambushed by two lesser snow golems on his watch. The party managed to defeat them when the hawk alerted them. Fire was super effective!)
- (x:: #FrostedMugs Continuing their long rest, [[Fern]] fell asleep during her watch and was startled awake after a mysterious visitor stole a couple ingots, their boots growing in size as they fled. On the third watch [[Oona the Cruncher]] saw a chwinga!)
- (x:: #FrostedMugs The ingots were successfully returned to [[Hruna]] et al who paid them *each* a 50g bloodstone. The hounds and sleds were returned, the job finished.)
