## About
This site was made began as a Zettelkasten style notebook using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) alongside the plugins [obsidian-dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). The theme is called ITS.

Junji's Tavern is our gaming group. Junji Ito is my dog ![[junji.png]].

### Github
Here is the source code for the vault itself, along with more of a README file about the notebook, plugins, and workflow in using this system for your own purposes. Note: the `.obsidian` folder has been purposely omitted, so you'll need to add the aforementioned plugins and theming.
