## Character Building
- **Feats are allowed**. Feats are allowed in place of Ability Score Improvements.
- **Dual multi-classing**. Allowed, but wait until you're past level 5.
- **Encumbrance & Carrying Capacity.** Track normal Encumbrance, but we won't hyper focus on it. Be pragmatic though. You can't carry a piano, and you probably don't have 10 swords strapped to you.
- **Money and Loot.** Track your loot please. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp), but you can consider them interchangeable if you'd like. Some physical loot like gems may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.

## Combat
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception, or like, a lot of eyes.
- **Surprise attacks**. Surprise gives advantage. Surprise requires an unseen attacker or unaware target.
- **Back attacks**. 
	- **Blindspots**. Attacking the rear of a monster whose size is larger than yours gives +1 to hit per size larger.
	- **Shields**. Shields only add to AC when facing the threat.
- **Cover**. Remember that half-cover gives +2 to AC and DEX saving throws, three-quarters cover gives +5, and total cover means you cannot be directly targeted. Nothing new here, just remember to track and use cover.
- **Potions of Healing can be self-administered with a bonus action**.  Other potions will still require a full action, as does administering to another character.
- **Meta-combat round.** Each round of combat may begin with a one-minute player phase, where meta strategy can be discussed. During combat, collaborating is encouraged via what can reasonably be articulated and interpreted by a character, but lengthy meta strategy discussion is discouraged. This is mostly to speed up the game.
- **Massive Damage.** Taking massive damage (>50% HP) may result in a CON save to see if *something like* a [System Shock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#MassiveDamage) effect occurs. Taking massive damage that knocks you unconscious may result in *something like* a [lingering injury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries).
- **Death Saves may be semi-private.** 

## General
- **Rule of Cool.** If you want to do something not in the rules, I may just let it happen. If you want to do something absolutely crazy, something perhaps with dire consequences, I may just say "that's cool, do it."
