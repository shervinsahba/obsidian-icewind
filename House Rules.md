## Combat
- **Bonus-action Potions**. Potions may be *self*-administered with a bonus action. Using your full action will automatically maximize the efficacy of the potion (i.e. max roll).
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception.
- **Surprise attacks**. Surprise gives advantage. Surprise requires an unseen attacker or unaware target.
- **Meta-combat round.** Each round of combat may have a one-minute player phase where meta strategy can be discussed. During combat, collaborating is encouraged via what can reasonably be articulated by a character, but lengthy discussion is discouraged.

## Exploration
- **Jumping downwards.** Characters can safely jump downwards 10 ft without taking fall damage. For every x additional feet, a DC x Athletics check is required to prevent fall damage.

## Spellcasting
- **Spell scrolls**. This house rule extends spell scroll casting to all classes. The caster must pass a check using their spellcasting ability or INT if they do not have a spellcasting ability. RAW, you can use a spell scroll if the spell is on your class list, and if it's of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must pass a DC 10+(spell level) check using your spellcasting ability else the spell fizzles. This rule extends casting to spell scrolls not on your class list, using a DC 10+2x(spell level) check, which applies to non-casters as well.

## Death, Injury, and Massive Damage
- **Dying Status**. Unconscious status is boring, so hitting 0 HP enters you into the *dying* condition unless otherwise stated. 
	- Roll death saving throws at the start of your turn like normal. 
	- Fall *prone*. You cannot use movement nor any of your actions to stand up while *dying*.
	- You may use your action or bonus action. However, each usage generates 4 levels of revised exhaustion. 
 - **Massive Damage.** Taking massive damage (>50% HP) may result in a CON save to see if *something like* a [System Shock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#MassiveDamage) effect occurs. Taking massive damage that knocks you unconscious may result in *something like* a [lingering injury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries).

## Character Building
- **Feats are allowed**. Feats are allowed in place of Ability Score Improvements.
- **Multi-classing is allowed**. Sounds good.
- **Ready a backup character.** Be ready to roll.
 
## Backpack
- **Encumbrance & Carrying Capacity.** Track normal Encumbrance, but we won't hyper focus on it. Be pragmatic.
- **Money and Loot.** Track your loot. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp). Other valuable loot like gems may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.

## General
- **Quick rulings!** We'll make quick rulings for most rule disputes. Make a note of the questions for later, so we can get a proper ruling for future cases.
- **Rule of Cool.** THE RULE OF COOL WINS!
