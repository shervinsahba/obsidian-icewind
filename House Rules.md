## Character Building
- **Feats are allowed**. Feats are allowed in place of Ability Score Improvements.
- **Multi-classing is allowed**. Sounds good.

## Backpack
- **Encumbrance & Carrying Capacity.** Track normal Encumbrance, but we won't hyper focus on it. Be pragmatic.
- **Money and Loot.** Track your loot. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp). Other valuable loot like gems may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.

## Combat
- **Potions may be self-administered with a bonus action**. Using your full action will automatically maximize the efficacy of the potion (i.e. max roll).
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception.
- **Surprise attacks**. Surprise gives advantage. Surprise requires an unseen attacker or unaware target.
- **Back attacks**. 
	- **Big guy blind spots give +1**. Attacking the rear of a monster whose size is larger than yours gives +1 to hit per size larger.
	- **Shields cover the front**. Shields only add to AC when facing the threat.
- **Meta-combat round.** Each round of combat may have a one-minute player phase where meta strategy can be discussed. During combat, collaborating is encouraged via what can reasonably be articulated by a character, but lengthy discussion is discouraged.

## Death, Injury, and Massive Damage
- **Dying Status**. Unconscious status is boring, so hitting 0 HP enters you into the *dying* condition unless otherwise stated. 
	- Roll death saving throws at the start of your turn like normal. 
	- Fall *prone*. You cannot use movement or any of your actions to stand up while *dying*.
	- You may move while *dying*. Because you are prone, your movement is halved. You cannot jump or climb.
	- You may use an action, bonus action, or reaction. However each action creates 2 levels of exhaustion. Bonus actions, reactions, and other special actions create 1 level of exhaustion.
 - **Massive Damage.** Taking massive damage (>50% HP) may result in a CON save to see if *something like* a [System Shock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#MassiveDamage) effect occurs. Taking massive damage that knocks you unconscious may result in *something like* a [lingering injury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries).
 - **Ready a backup character.** Be ready to roll.


## General
- **Quick rulings. Let's look it up later.** We'll make quick rulings for most rule disputes. Make a note of the questions for later, so we can get a proper ruling for future cases.
- **Rule of Cool.** THE RULE OF COOL WINS!
