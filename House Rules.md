## Character Building
- **Feats are allowed**. Feats are allowed in place of Ability Score Improvements.
- **Dual multi-classing**. Allowed, but maybe wait until you're past level 5.
- **Encumbrance & Carrying Capacity.** Track normal Encumbrance, but we won't hyper focus on it. Be pragmatic though. You can't carry a piano, and you probably don't have 10 swords strapped to you.
- **Money.** Track your loot please. Gold and silver will be used are are effectively interchangeable items. 1gp=10sp.

## Combat
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception, or like, a lot of eyes.
- **Back attacks**
- **Potions of Healing can be self-administered with a bonus action**. However, replace the lowest dice roll with a 1 unless you have a perfect roll. For a Greater, Superior, and Supreme potion, you replace the lowest two, three, or four die with 1's. 
- **Meta-combat round.** Each round of combat begins with a one-minute player phase, where meta strategy can be discussed. During combat, collaborating is disallowed outside what can be reasonably articulated and interpreted by a PC on their turn. This is mostly to speed up the game.
- **Massive Damage.** Taking massive damage (>50% HP) may result in a CON save to see if *something like* a [System Shock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#MassiveDamage) effect occurs. Taking massive damage that knocks you unconscious may result in *something like* a [lingering injury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries).
- **Death Saves may be semi-private.** 

## General
- **Rule of Cool.** If you want to do something not in the rules, I may just let it happen. If you want to do something absolutely crazy, something perhaps with dire consequences, I may just say "that's cool, do it."
