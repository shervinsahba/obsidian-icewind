## Combat
- **Bonus-action potions**. Potions may be *self*-administered with a bonus action. Using your full action will automatically maximize the efficacy of the potion (i.e. max roll).
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception.
- **Meta-combat round.** Each round of combat may have a one-minute player phase where meta strategy can be discussed. During combat, collaborating is encouraged via what can reasonably be articulated by a character, but lengthy discussion is discouraged.

## Exploration and Movement
- **Jumping downwards.** Characters can safely jump downwards 10 ft without taking fall damage. For every x additional feet, a DC x Athletics check is required to prevent fall damage.
- **Pragmatic encumbrance.** Track normal encumbrance and abide by sensible carrying capacity restrictions. We won't hyper focus on it. Just be pragmatic.

## Spellcasting
- **Spell scrolls for all**. Any class may attempt to use a spell scroll. If the spell is on your class list and of a level you can normally cast, it triggers perfectly, but if it is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must pass a DC 10+(Spell Level) check using your spellcasting ability modifier, else the spell fizzles. If the spell is not on your class list, you must pass a DC 10+2x(Spell Level) check using the higher of your spellcasting ability modifier, if relevant, or your intelligence. A spell that fizzles will still consume the scroll.

## Death and Status Conditions
- **Dying Status**. Unconscious status is boring, so hitting 0 HP enters you into the *dying* condition unless otherwise stated. 
	- Immediately fall *prone*. You cannot end the *prone* status while *dying*.
	- Roll death saving throws at the start of your turn like normal. 
	- You may use your action, bonus action, or reaction. However, each usage generates 4 levels of revised exhaustion. 
 
## General
- **Quick rulings!** We'll make quick rulings for most rule disputes. Make a note of the questions for later, so we can get a proper ruling for future cases.
- **Track your loot.** Keep tabs on these. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp). Some valuable loot like may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.
- **Rule of Cool.** It always wins.
