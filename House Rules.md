## Character Building
- **Feats are allowed**. Feats are allowed in place of Ability Score Improvements.
- **Dual multi-classing**. Allowed after 5th level.
- **Encumbrance & Carrying Capacity.** Track normal Encumbrance, but we won't hyper focus on it. Be pragmatic. You can't carry a piano, and you probably can't adventure with 10 swords.
- **Money and Loot.** Track your loot please. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp), but you can consider them interchangeable if you'd like. Some physical loot like gems may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.


## Combat
- **Potions of Healing can be self-administered with a bonus action**.  Other potions will still require a full action, as does administering to another character.
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception.
- **Surprise attacks**. Surprise gives advantage. Surprise requires an unseen attacker or unaware target.
- **Back attacks**. 
	- **Big guy blind spots give +1**. Attacking the rear of a monster whose size is larger than yours gives +1 to hit per size larger.
	- **Shields cover the front**. Shields only add to AC when facing the threat.
- **Cover**. Track your own coverage! This is just a reminder, and not a new rule. Half-cover gives +2 to AC and DEX saving throws, three-quarters cover gives +5, and total cover means you cannot be directly targeted.
- **Meta-combat round.** Each round of combat may begin with a one-minute player phase, where meta strategy can be discussed. During combat, collaborating is encouraged via what can reasonably be articulated and interpreted by a character, but lengthy meta strategy discussion is discouraged. This is mostly to speed up the game.


## Death, Injury, and Massive Damage
- **Death Saves may be semi-private.** This can be done at the dying player's or DM's discretion.
- **Dying Status**. Unconscious status is boring, so hitting 0 HP enters you into the *dying* condition unless otherwise stated. 
	- You roll death saving throws at the start of your turn like normal. 
	- When *dying*, you fall *prone* and cannot use movement or any of your actions to stand up.
	- You may freely move. Because you are prone, your movement is halved.
	- You may elect to use an action, bonus action, or reaction. However that choice comes with a cost: 2 levels of exhaustion for an action and 1 level for either a bonus action or reaction.
 - **Massive Damage.** Taking massive damage (>50% HP) may result in a CON save to see if *something like* a [System Shock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#MassiveDamage) effect occurs. Taking massive damage that knocks you unconscious may result in *something like* a [lingering injury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries).
 - **Ready a backup character.** Be ready to roll.


## General
- **Minimize rule-lawyering.** I aim to quickly arbitrate rulings. Make a note of questions and give it to me later, so we can get a proper ruling for future cases.
- **Rule of Cool.** If you want to do something not in the rules, I may just let it happen. If you want to do something absolutely crazy, something perhaps with dire consequences, I may just say "that's cool, do it."
