## Combat
- **Bonus-action potions**. Potions may be *self*-administered with a bonus action. Using your full action will automatically maximize the efficacy of the potion (i.e. max roll).
- **Flanking**. Flanking gives advantage to hit, unless the creature has exceptionally high Perception.
- **Meta-combat.** It's encouraged to use your turn to shout ideas to other characters. Otherwise, keep meta strategy to a minimum, both for time savings and immersion's sake. 

## Exploration and Movement
- **Jumping downwards.** Characters can safely jump downwards 10 ft without taking fall damage. For every X additional feet, a `DC X Athletics or Acrobatics` check is required to prevent fall damage.
- **Pragmatic encumbrance.** Abide by sensible carrying capacity considerations. No need to track. Just be pragmatic.

## Spellcasting
- **Spell scrolls for the masses**. Any class may attempt to use a spell scroll. *If the spell is not on your class list*, you must pass a `DC 10+2x(Spell Level)` check using the higher of your spellcasting ability modifier, if relevant, or your intelligence. A spell that fizzles will consume the scroll. If the spell is on your class list and of a level you can normally cast, it triggers perfectly. If it is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must pass a `DC 10+(Spell Level)` check using your spellcasting ability modifier, else the spell fizzles. 

## Death and Status Conditions
- **Dying Status**. Hitting 0 HP enters you into the *dying* condition unless otherwise stated.
	- Roll death saving throws at the start of your turn like normal.
	- You are *incapacitated*. You can still move, speak, be aware of surroundings, and make free object interactions.
	- Drop what your holding and fall *prone*. You cannot end the *prone* status while *dying*.
	- Strength and Dexterity saving throws can be made at the cost of 2 revised exhaustion.
	- Attack rolls against you have advantage.
	- Any attack that hits you is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.
- **Final Action**. If you fail three death saving throws, then you die. You may take a final action.

## General
- **Quick rulings!** We'll make quick rulings for most rule disputes. Make a note of the questions for later, so we can get a proper ruling for future cases.
- **Track your loot.** Keep tabs on these. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp). Some valuable loot like may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.
- **Rule of Cool.** It always wins.
