## Caves of Hunger
- (x:: #TheChosen #TheCavesOfHunger [[Tekeli-li]] is fought. Tattered and bloodied, she eats her arm as her sanity slips and her ferocity increases. She escapes the sunlight once again to regroup.)
- (x:: #TheForgottenRealm Taking a short rest and realizing how much time has elapsed, the party notices that their magical items no longer recharge at dawn.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger A gelatinous mimic cube surprises the party as they explore what they thought were slabs of Netherese ruins.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger The party comes across a brooding figure in tattered black silks and a golden mask who is partially encased within the icy walls. [[Professor Skant|Skant]] deduces it to be a mummy lord, once an emissary from another Netherese enclave -- Thultanthar, the City of [[Netherese|Shade]]. He had been brought to discuss planar magic with the mages of [[Ythryn]] in regards to an artifact referred to as the spindle. He seemed dangerous, so the party decided to move onward.)
- (x:: #TheChosen #TheCavesOfHunger [[Tekeli-li]] is killed within the dryad's grove.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger The isolated dryad and the purple pears that grant cantrips.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger #TheForgottenRealm The eye sacrifice room has a physical manifestation. It is bleeding and ajar. There are dead nothics in the corner. The door opens to grand precipice overlooking [[Ythryn]], though the party deduces another path for a safer decent.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger The frost giant [[Vlagomir]]'s spark is received by [[Crank]].)
