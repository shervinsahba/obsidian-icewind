## Sunblight Fortress: Versus Xardorok
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot There was a chance that Muzgardt aligned duergar resided on the forge level, and it would be better to have their help sooner than later. [[Fern]] donned the hat of disguise, masking herself as a duergar soldier. Putting on her best gray dwarf impersonation, she went to pry around the barracks. There were at least a dozen of them, several duergar playing cards with many more in their quarters. After a confused duergar began to prod a bit at her presence, she made an excuse to leave. Snooping around the forge watch towers nearest to them, she was able to suss out that one of the three at each post was [[Olpha Muzgardt|Olpha]]'s plant. Returning to Olpha's chambers, the old dwarf princess and her right hand [[Ulkin]] said they were running out of time; the soldiers in the command level were about to dine and a shift may head below.)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot The forge level barracks had to be dealt with, decided [[Crank]]. Back by [[Oona]] and the others, they waltzed in and flashed the Muzgardt symbol. It took some persuasion but quickly duergar were taking arms against duergar in a battle royale. [[Gadget]] dispatched several with a thunderwave, whose blast brought the attention of the duergar on the guard towers. Mopping up the remnants, the party had added a cadre of bruised but determined Muzgardt soldiers to their ranks. While regrouping, [[Crank]] crept down a tower walkway, taking in the full view of the dragon heart forge from which pools of molten chardalyn flowed. Present below were two armed guard towers, a cabal of quaggoths, and Xardorok Sunblight, standing near his gargantuan obsession, the [[Chardalyn Dragon]]. Xardorok's eye met Crank's as the monk stepped back to inform the party to get ready.)
- (x:: #battle #ADuergarPlot Our heroes stormed the forge through every possible avenue. Crank jumped into the pit and rushed for [[Xardorok Sunblight]], [[Azgul]] and [[Tetro]] fired spells from the cleared guard towers, [[Fern]] masked their casters with darkness, [[Gadget]] led the vanguard of Muzgardt duergar, and [[Oona]] flanked the quaggoth warriors through the Temple of Deep Duerra. An enemy forewoman rushed to the [[Chardalyn Dragon]]'s iron service platform but was enwebbed and died in flames. Xardorok, briefly stunned by the bugbear monk, went invisible and began monologuing to the interloping heroes about his imminent victory. As the party lost sight of him, they cut through several more quaggoth until they heard the click of a lever. Through the hiss of steam, the dragon spoke NEW DATE. TONIGHT IS THE FEAST OF THE MOON. PREPARING SYSTEMS FOR ANNIHILATION. Xardorok had reset his dragon to attack this evening, though the true Feast of the Moon lie two nights ahead.  HOSTILITIES DETECTED. MALEVOLENCE PROTOCOL ENGAGED. A radiant beam disintegrated two duergar and felled [[Olpha]] before the dragon clawed up the exit shaft, pushing off towards Ten Towns.)
- (x:: #battle #ADuergarPlot Picking themselves up, our heroes pushed back as three duergar hammerer units made their way from the far side of the forge. [[Olpha Muzgardt|Olpha]] polymorphed a duergar into a chicken atop one guard tower, inspiring her comrades up top to fight back. The front lines of the quaggoths began to fall under the pressure on the main floor. Alit by [[Tetro]]'s shooting star, a bloodied [[Xardorok Sunblight|Xardorok]]'s eye stumbled as [[Crank]] shoved a sussur branch into his eye. It shattered, as eye puss trickled down, and he began to cackle. Enlarging himself in an agonizing shout, chardalyn growths rapidly spurted from his flesh. Xardorok, subject to the sussur branch's influence, had little control over what happened next. Pillars of earth randomly erupted. [[Gadget]] and [[Ulkin]] were pinned to the ceiling, some 30 feet high, and [[Azgul]] dodged away from a tower of the black earth as he was shut out from the guard tower. The numbers soon turned on Sunblight, however, and he died in rapture, as Azgul's spectral servant severed the last chords binding his soul to his flesh.)
