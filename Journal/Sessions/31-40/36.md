## Sunblight Fortress: Versus Xardorok
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot There was a chance that Muzgardt aligned duergar resided on the forge level, and it would be better to have their help sooner than later, once the spells hit the fan with Xardorok and the his Chardalyn Dragon. [[Fern]] donned the hat of disguise, turning into a duergar soldier. Putting on her best gray dwarf impersonation, she eyed the numbers in the room. There were at least a dozen of them, several out playing cards and many more in their quarters. After a confused duergar began to prod a bit at her presence, she doubled back to snoop out the forge watch towers nearest to them, sussing out that one of the three at each post was [[Olpha Muzgardt|Olpha]]'s plant.)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot The forge level barracks had to be dealt with. )
