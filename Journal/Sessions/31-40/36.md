## Sunblight Fortress: Versus Xardorok
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot There was a chance that Muzgardt aligned duergar resided on the forge level, and it would be better to have their help sooner than later. [[Fern]] donned the hat of disguise, masking herself as a duergar soldier. Putting on her best gray dwarf impersonation, she went to pry around the barracks. There were at least a dozen of them, several duergar playing cards with many more in their quarters. After a confused duergar began to prod a bit at her presence, she made an excuse to leave. Snooping around the forge watch towers nearest to them, she was able to suss out that one of the three at each post was [[Olpha Muzgardt|Olpha]]'s plant. Returning to Olpha's chambers, the old dwarf princess and her right hand [[Ulkin]] said they were running out of time; the soldiers in the command level were about to dine and a shift may head below.)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot The forge level barracks had to be dealt with, decided [[Crank]]. Back by [[Oona]] and the others, they waltzed in and flashed the Muzgardt symbol. It took some persuasion but quickly duergar were taking arms against duergar in a battle royale. [[Gadget]] dispatched several with a thunderwave, whose blast brought the attention of the duergar on the guard towers. Mopping up the remnants, the party had added a cadre of bruised but determined Muzgardt soldiers to their ranks.)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot A plan was hatched to surround the forge. [[Crank]] crept down a tower walkway, taking in the full view of the dragon heart forge from which pools of molten chardalyn flowed, two armed guard towers, a cabal of quaggoths, and Xardorok Sunblight, standing near his gargantuan obsession, the [[Chardalyn Dragon]].)
