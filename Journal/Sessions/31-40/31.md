> **`=this.summary`**
> The Underdark expedition was leading our heroes towards a Sunblight mining colony. There, a purported Duergar princess of the Muzgardt clan had been summoned to court the warlock king himself, Xardorok. Accompanying a goliath named Aruk and a myconid named Sensei, who each wished to rescue their friends, the party fought their way forward. After a harrowing encounter on an ancient dwarven bridge, the party crept close to the colony. Aruk Thundercaller, however, did not make it.

## Underdark Expedition
- (x:: #UnderdarkExpedition  [[Mev Flintknapper]] told the party they're crazy to head towards [[Sunblight Fortress]], but, as they stood on one face of a chasm spanned by a lone bridge spanning a river of lava, he did warn them to take heed of awakening any stirges. Stirges, they recalled, are rat sized flying bloodsuckers, and the far cavern walls seemed to be pocked with their nesting holes. Across this bridge was the duergar mining colony where [[Sloopidoop]], [[Aruk Thundercaller]], and [[Sensei]] landed when teleporting away from Sunblight's prisons. There, the party was told, was a Duergar princess from the Muzgardt clan. [[Xardorok Sunblight]] had summoned the woman to court her, but the rumor in the mining colony, which sounded like a somewhat open city for Underdark trade despite the presence of the Sunblight clan, was that the princess was of an independent mind.)
- (x:: #battle #UnderdarkExpedition If crossing the ancient dwarven bridge wasn't foreboding enough, the large creature's shell in the middle of the pathways certainly proved ominous. [[Jarnathan the familiar]] nearly singed its whiskers off when scouting. The party decided to push through, calling out the magma whelk within the shell. As the foe delayed their transit, the sounds of battle stirred the cave walls. An exponentially growing number of stirges poured into the air. [[Crank]], the first to cross the chasm into the cool crevasse on the other side, noted that the stirges did not pursue. He called for his companions to run. Felling the whelk, the party dashed to safety, and as they collapsed into the crack in the wall, the swarm of stirges descending on [[Aruk Thundercaller]] at the rear. Enveloped in a hundred stirges, Aruk beseeched the party to save his captive brother, the goliath [[Kapanuk Talltree]]. Aruk then fell from the bridge, lifelessly.)
