> **`=this.summary`**
> Entering a Duergar controlled mining colony, the party took to disguising themselves as well as cloaking Sensei, who was unfortunately considered a delicacy among some gray dwarves. They soon found themselves admist a center of trade, where commonfolk duergar kept to themselves under the oppressive presence of the Sunblight Clan.

## The Town of Thizrun
- (x:: #UnderdarkExpedition  The party neared the Duergar mining colony, whose lamp lights were seen a mile down in the cavernous valley's floor. [[Sensei]] worried that their own presence would be met with possible hostility, since some duergar were known for prizing myconid flesh. Therefore the party took efforts to conceal themselves. They told Sensei to play dead, as they carted her in through the town's outer guardpost, claiming they had myconid for sale. [[Tetro]] took the form of a mule, and [[Fern]] decided to conceal her tiefling self, though tucking the tail proved troublesome. She applied some grey tint to [[Gadget]] so that she may appear to be a deep gnome. The half-orcs, [[Oona]] and [[Azgul]], along with the bugbear [[Crank]] felt their presence was fine, given that the town below was reputedly frequented by other Underdark dwellers for trade. )
