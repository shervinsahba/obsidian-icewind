## Destruction's Light
- (x:: #DestructionsLight  Catching their breath in the blood-stained forge, our heroes laid out the maps and debated on their best course of action as the [[Chardalyn Dragon]] was already enroute to Ten Towns. First it would strike [[Caer Dineval]], then [[Bremen]]. [[Gadget]] asked the duergar engineers for weaknesses. There were none. In fact, the construct was designed to resist the cold, and as a construct, it was immune to typical charms and fears. The beast could even absorb magic, up to a limit. Their best bet would be to ground it, not a small feat. As for getting there, the goliath [[Kapanuk Talltree]] was willing to return a favor. His scrimshaw horn in hand, they headed to the ice gate atop the fortress, and the goliath called for the griffons of [[Wyrmdoom Crag]].)
- (x:: #DestructionsLight The griffons' flight to Ten Towns was met with the piercing winds of the tundra. The dim skies and light snow obscured their vision, but [[Azgul]] spotted the dragon heading off towards [[Bremen]]. Perhaps the griffons could beat it and save some lives.[[Gadget]] would entrust [[Kapanuk Talltree]] with tinkered stones, clear evacuation and battle instructions for the town and its neighbors. They themselves would land in [[Easthaven]] and prepare for battle. A sunrise shone across Icewind Dale as they closed in, dying as quickly as it rose. Inspired by the brief light, the heroes steeled themselves. They were going to fight a dragon.)
- (x: #DestructionsLight They had few hours. Enough for a quick rest. But more importantly, they needed to prepare. The skies had cleared, and so [[Tetro]] cast *Skywrite* notifying all towns of the imminent attack. Panicked townsfolk were rushing to shelters. A wounded man and his animals were aided by [[Oona]]'s strength. [[Fern]] helped a child look for his mother as a crowd crush was broken up by guards in the market alleys. [[Gadget]] and [[Crank]] sought the militia armorers, demanding iron nets for the ballista to launch. [[Azgul]] found a harried [[Danneth Waylen]], and after getting the lay of the town's defensive capabilities, he forced the Speaker to take cover with trusted men, before going to look Captain [[Imdra Arlaggath]] at the town's southern watchtowers.)
- (x:: #DestructionsLight #TheDevilYouKnow [[Azgul]], [[Oona]], and [[Crank]] started making their way towards [[Imdra Arlaggath]] at the southern watchtower, while the remaining party tended to preparations near the East Way. A cloaked figure was tending to her sled, and the stopped abruptly upon passing her. That was [[Vellynne Harpell]]. A shrewd Vellynne askd if [[Azgul]] was going to turn into a black ooze, like the one who had been accompanying her for the last week did. [[Crank]] took out the sample from the [[Lost Spire]] and Vellynne nodded. Yes, that ooze. With the pressure of the dragon on everyone's minds, the wizened wizard acquiesced to lend them a hand, noting their heroics. She kept her one good eye on the half-orc warlock, nonetheless.)
- (x:: #battle #DestructionsLight With cries for arms, the tumolt turned to terror, as cries of battle rang out. [[Oona]], [[Crank]], and [[Azgul]] rushed to the watch tower, only to see a knifed Imdra fall from the tower. Across the city, the duergar assault had begun. By the time our heroes felled the fire lance wielding duergar xarrorn, Captain Arlaggath had died.)
- (x:: #battle #DestructionsLight With the dust of the ground battle settling in their vicinity, shouts of fear arose. The [[Chardalyn Dragon]] was approaching and fast. [[Fern]] and [[Gadget]] prepared a ballista for a clean shot, entrusting the stalwart [[Tetro]] to its aim as they ran for cover. Soon, the skies flashed alight, dragon's breath rending the southeastern expanse of [[Easthaven]] in a radiant beam. Ballista shots fired off, ripped chunks of chardalyn from the winged calamity. It took off for the eastern districts, toppling a structure in the distance.)
