summary: The Cold Crone. Aspect of Preservation.
saga: Solstice
description: Within the Codicil of White the party discovered the Rime Incantation, a familiar song now presented in its truest form. This ritual holds the power to open the frozen waterfall at Reghed Glacier, unsealing the route towards the Netherese necropolis of Ythryn. Within the Codicil, the party also uncovered Auril's infernal legacy. In the Dawn War -- the Age Before Ages -- the devil known as Auril struck down a primordial titan Dur-baagal on behalf of the gods-to-be. In doing so the devil achieved divinity, honored as Auril the Icedawn. The party, armed with this information, fled Grimskalle only to be intercepted by the Cold Crone and her roc. Cutting through, the face of the ice witch Hedrun blurred through the Cold Crone's visage. This two-spirit being was Auril's Aspect of Preservation. As defeat loomed, the goddess's power merged Crone and roc into the Rime Beast. Felling the creature and severing the Cold Crone's tether to Auril's magic, the dying ice witch glared at the sky, slowly spiraling into a winter storm of unreasonable measure. "She is coming. You have taken what is not yours... and are heading where you do not belong. She sees you. She is coming."

## Grimskalle's Gateway to the Four Winds
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden #TheChosen The party retrieves the Codicil of White. They then fight Auril's Aspect of Preservation, the Cold Crone Hedrun. The Ice Witch had been wild-shaped by the goddess herself into a dual spirit to act as her avatar. Slaying the roc and wounding the Cold Crone, she merged flesh to form the Rime Beast. With her dying words, she swore their transgression with the Codicil of White was seen by Auril herself. Their mind was known. And Auril would come.)
