## Returning to Easthaven
- (x:: #CauldronCaper [[Tetro]] dragged the cauldron back to [[Easthaven]]. Along the way, the party encountered a band of Goliath warriors. They kept their distance, as the surly lot seemed disinterested in them as they headed into town.)
- (x:: #CauldronCaper At the [[Easthaven#White Lady Inn|White Lady Inn]], [[Hazel]] begins prying the proprietor [[Bartaban]] about whether he'd be interested in a magical cauldron. The overly eager Bart, almost salivating at a chance to create ceaseless soup for his tavern was eventually dismayed as the party decided to gauge the value of the vat elsewhere. Eventually this led them to the [[Easthaven#Town Hall| Easthaven Town Hall]].)
- (x:: #CauldronCaper At the [[Easthaven#Town Hall| Easthaven Town Hall]], a large three story building with several guards and attendants that serves as both political offices and community center for the city, the party split into two groups. [[Tetro]], [[Hazel]], and [[Oona]] chewed the chud with the towns guards in the reception hall while watching the cauldron. [[Azgul]], [[Crank]], and [[Fern]] headed into )
- (x:: #ChardalynCaper [[Fern]] cast detect magic on the remnants of the chardalyn figurehead, which hummed with a dark aura of enchantment. [[Azgul]] sought tracks and found chardalyn speckles glowing in a band of footprints, hurrying about the figurehead statue before taking flight to the west of town hall, losing sight of them near the waterfront near the [[Easthaven]] ferry.)
