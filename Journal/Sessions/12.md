# Chronicles

## Exploring Bremen

- (x:: #LakeMonster Having hauled the carcass of [[Maer Dualdon]]'s awakened plesiosaur back to the [[Bremen]] docks, the party carved out a *plesiosaur hide* and *12 rations* of meat. [[Tali]] was given the head of the beast to study and offered to introduce the party to a friend of hers who studies [[Chwinga]].)
- (x:: #NatureSpirits [[Tali]] introduced the party to [[Dannika Graysteel]], a scholar who has been staying in [[Bremen]] for months searching for hints of [[Chwinga]] activity. Dannika's nose is more in her books than her legs are in the field, though. She gives the party a *lantern of tracking* that purportively glows greenish-blue in the presence of the nature spirits.)
- (x:: #BlackSwords Wrapping up their lodging at the local inn, [[Bremen#BuriedTreasures|Buried Treasures]], they took note of the distraught and nervous local innkeeper, [[Cora Mulphoon]]. Cora beseeches the adventurers to bring news of her missing young adult son, [[Huarwar Mulphoon]]. Huarwar went missing during a blizzard while searching for town's doddering elderly speaker, [[Dorbulgruf Shalescar|Dorbulgruf]]. Huarwar returned days later, but was cold and distant. Cora found a peculiar black stone in his room, which Huarwar angrily snatched back from her. )
