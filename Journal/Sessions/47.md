summary: The Blue Fire of Endurance
saga: Solstice
description: On the outskirts of Solstice Isle our heroes fought The Endurance — a Chillbringer, an Aspect of the Frostmaiden. While his body was destroyed, his heart remained, and Fern cut it out and placed it within their Bag of Holding. Pushing forward to Grimskalle, the party contended with frostmourn remnants of the once proud giants of Vassavicken. Soon they found themselves at the Hall of Four Winds, where Auril's trials began. Materializing near Reghed Glacier, perhaps in a dream, they were taunted by Bjornhilde of the Tiger Tribe before being guided to a dark crack in the ice. Within, they experienced Isolation.
