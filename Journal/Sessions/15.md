## Good Mead
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow As the party was preparing to leave town, a scuffle broke out at the [[Good Mead]] hall. Several thugs were running away, licking their wounds as [[Shandar Froth]] and his loggers hollered at them to get lost. [[Oona]] grappled a thug.[[Crank]] clotheslined another, picking him up with an arm for questioning. [[Crank]] recognized the Zhentarim flunky, and it was soon revealed that these thugs lost on purpose by the orders of [[Naerth Maxildannar]] to make Shandar look good. With onlookers watching the scene, Shandar was exposed. He admitted to the deception but said he did have the town's interest in heart and that, in truth, the Zhentarim had been blackmailing him to keep his past from catching up. He was a man wanted for murder in [[Mirabar]]. With Shandar outed, it seems [[Olivessa Untapoor]] will become speaker.)
## Easthaven
- (x:: #ToilAndTrouble The party entered [[Easthaven]] around dusk after hearing about missing sailors on Lac Dinneshire. [[Crank]] recalled that it'd be wise to watch your pockets: pick-pocketing is legal in the town, unless you're caught red-handed. The settlement honors the tradition of sacrifice since its frontier days, but only offers convicts to the goddess of cold.)
- (x:: #DzaanIsDead An execution was taking place in the town square. Throngs of [[Easthaven]] residents were gathering near a wood pile just set ablaze, relishing in not just its heat but the death of the Red Wizard [[Dzaan]], who the party caught sight of as he went up in flame. Dzaan's eyes frantically scanned through the crowd, glazing over his Arcane Brotherhood colleagues, [[Vellynne Harpell]] and another, soon to be introduced as [[Avarice]], before locking on [[Azgul]]'s. Perceptive party members saw Azgul's eyes widen and pupils dilate ever so slightly.)
