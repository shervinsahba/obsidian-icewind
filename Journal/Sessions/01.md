# Chronicles

## Ten Road to Icewind Dale
- (x:: The party began travel from [[Luskan]], south of the [[Spine of the World Mountain]], to Icewind Dale. They were being guided along [[Ten Road]], which has become increasingly treacherous, by guides from the [[Luskan Deliverers]].)
- (x:: #SpecialDelivery [[Oona]] and [[Crank]] have been working gigs for the [[Luskan Deliverers]], a merchant and courier guild. The were tasked with delivering a small parcel - an unmarked, unhinged metal box - to a [[Bryn Shander#Characters|Ragammel]] in the town of [[Bryn Shander]]. The commissioner was reportedly an [[Arcane Brotherhood]] member named [[Maccath]].) 
- (x:: #SpecialDelivery [[Azgul]], [[Tetro]], [[Hazel]], and [[Fern]] were all either being guided to Icewind Dale or happened across the traveling party.)
- (x:: The party found 100g in the remains of a frozen over (and animal mauled) carcass of another trader traveller.)
- (x:: #battle The party encountered an ogre and baby owlbear. The ogre called out to the baby owlbear's mother who also attacked. The party defeated them all and departed as the baby's cries filled the silent air. The cries eventually triggered an avalanche. )
- (x:: Nearing Icewind Dale and cresting the [[Spine of the World]], the skies progressively darkened until all that was felt was the darkness of winter.)
- (x:: #battle A blizzard picked up on the flatlands of Icewind Dale as the party closed in on [[Bryn Shander]]. Keeping an eye out for the warm fires of Bryn's towers, they instead spotted three spectral blue lights. On closer inspection and as they neared the city walls, they saw the lights belonged to cold light walkers, who attacked the group. The group narrowly escaped the icy grip of the cold light walkers, assisted by an armored polar bear who tackled their primary assailant. )

## Bryn Shander
- (x:: Arriving at night, the party made their way to the tavern [[Bryn Shander#Kelvin's Comfort (Tavern)|Kelvin's Comfort]] at the center of town. The proprietor [[Bryn Shander#Characters|Ogden Flamebeard]] gave them a room and turned a bit sour when Ragammel was asked about. Ogden eventually retired for the evening and kicked back several firewater whiskies, while a pageboy took over.)
- (x:: #SpecialDelivery [[Ragammel]], who had lodging at the tavern, eventually made his way downstairs for a meal. The package was delivered, a magical sigil illuminating after interacting with Ragammel's dragontooth necklace. The [[Luskan Deliverers]] were paid 60g for its receipt. )
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller [[Hlin Trollbane]] had entered the tavern. Observing the party for a while, the veteran bounty huntress approached the party with a warning and request: murders were occuring in IWD. One in [[Easthaven]] a month back, another here in [[Bryn Shander]] two weeks ago, and one recently reported in [[Targos]].)
