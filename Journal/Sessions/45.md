## Temple of the Four Gods
- (x::  #battle #FourGodsofFury It seemed that [[Crank]]'s lycanthropy was a  curse treatable by an exceptiounally learned sage or perhaps with a barter with a fey being. With the full moon five days away, the party thought it best to push onward. Crank braced for the worst as he activated the challenge in [[Malar]]'s chamber. Three werewolves spawned in the water... and began to drown. It dawned on [[Gadget]] that this room very never meant to be submerged. Still, the party had to fight against the pack of wolves, avoiding their teeth and the curse it carried.)
- (x::  #battle #FourGodsofFury Sidling up to the western door of the great hall, the party readied to burst into the hall and take out the remaining sahuagin. [[Tetro]], though, had other ideas. With a thunderclap, the stone doors flew out. A dozen enraged sahuagin, including a baron, stared down the party before Tetro called on his most powerful magic to conjure a whirlpool within the hall. The vortex was a stunning display of the druid's growing might, and the rest of the party took aim at the fish in the barrel. [[Crank]], of course, was stuck in the center of the damn thing, clocking out sahuagin while his head began to pulse with the first glimmers of lycanthropic madness.)
- (x::  #FourGodsofFury In the chamber of [[Auril]], [[Fern]] managed to convince a lone sahuagin priestess, who was tended to a wall of eggs, that the head priestess has abandoned the enclave and that she herself should go on vacation. The sahuagin blinked, grabbed a clutch of specific eggs, and left. Auril's trial, which Gadget attempted, was similarly not meant to be performed underwater. A jet of cold flash froze the room, encasing [[Oona]], [[Tetro]], and [[Gadget]] who began to suffocate, as only the tiny bubble of air near their lips was open to speech. Fern and [[Crank]] rushed to dig their comrades out, but the ice was extremely thick. Gadget, though, had several tricks up her sleeve. Vortex warping Tetro to safety, she herself misty stepped out of bounds. From there, Oona's rescue was quickly met. The mass of magical ice melted over the next quarter hour.)
