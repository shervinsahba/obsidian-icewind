## Aftermath of the Chardalyn Dragon
- (x:: In the aftermath of the Chardalyn Dragon's destruction, the party accompanies a caravan of survivors from [[Easthaven]] to [[Bryn Shander]] as Ten Towns gathers for mourning during the holy day, the Feast of the Moon. In their company, [[Danneth Waylen]] relays all the information he can. [[Bremen]] and [[Caer Dineval]] have fallen, though the Caer itself was surprisingly untouched. Easthaven, while standing, is a wreck. Its harbor and market districts suffered heavy damage. Duergar attacks were put down in the remaining of the cities with minimal casualties.)
