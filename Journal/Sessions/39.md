## Aftermath of the Chardalyn Dragon
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon In the aftermath of the Chardalyn Dragon's destruction, the party accompanied a caravan of survivors from [[Easthaven]] to [[Bryn Shander]] as Ten Towns gathered for mourning during the Feast of the Moon, the holy day bridging the 11th and 12th month. In their company, [[Danneth Waylen]] relayed all the information he could. [[Bremen]] and [[Caer Dineval]] had fallen, though the caer itself was surprisingly unscathed. Easthaven, while standing, was a wreck. Duergar attacks were put down in the remaining of the cities with minimal casualties.)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Outside the gates of [[Bryn Shander]], the corpse of [[Morin Sunblight]] was strung up as an offering to the cold. [[Vellynne Harpell]] looked upon it and paused, while the party moved towards the markets, now bustling with refugee tents. The cauldron of plenty had been moved from [[Easthaven]] into town for the gathering, many a table quickly set up for the feast. Dalefolk were taking to a stage, reciting lineages and recounting history. [[Crank]] caught [[Naerth Maxildannar]]'s eye, the [[Targos]] speaker quickly abandoning his conversation with [[Duvessa Shane]] to rally the crowd behind our esteemed heroes. Speakers, or representatives members from the towns, addressed the masses on each of their homes.)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for [[Bryn Shander]], [[Duvessa Shane]] remarked at her town's fortitude. Now a center for several hundred refugees, she committed her city to the survival of all Dalefolk in this everlasting winter. She applauded the efforts of [[Termalaine]], where a large duergar vanguard was combated by the mining guilds, leading to the capture and death of [[Morin Sunblight]].)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for [[Termalaine]], [[Oarus Masthew]] could not hold back tears. In his stead, [[Marta Pekryk]] spoke of the miners guild's victory as well as the sacking of the [[Termalaine#The Blue Clam|Blue Clam]]. Chef [[Vernon Braig]] was noted among the dead.)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for [[Easthaven]], [[Danneth Waylen]] recounted the grim happenings of the dragon scourge, as well as the heroics of the [[Heroes of the Cairn]]. His captain, [[Imdra Arlaggath]] was counted amongst many other dead.)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for both [[Caer Dineval]] and [[Caer Konig]], [[Danneth Waylen]] continued, relaying reports from their scouts. The people of Caer Dineval stood no chance. Among the dead were tavernkeeper [[Roark]], the deposed speaker [[Crannoc Siever]], and his contentious hand [[Kadroth]]. Caer Konig, it seems, was not a target of attack. [[Trovus]] had been sobered up somewhat, and the veteran was currently entrusted with the town's security. What worried the scouts, though, were sightings of coldlight walkers - standing as if in wait - amongst the outer ruins of Caer Dineval and Easthaven)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for [[Targos]] and [[Bremen]], [[Naerth Maxildannar]] lamented the suffering of Ten Towns, including the total destruction of [[Bremen]], alongside several deaths in his own city during skirmishes. Still, Targos was standing strong and was taking in [[Bremen]] and [[Easthaven]] refugees, as well as providing resources to Speaker [[Danneth Waylen|Waylen]] for reconstruction efforts. The dead included [[Torg]], [[Grynsk Berylbore]], [[Tali]], [[Dannika Graysteel]], [[Cora Mulphoon]], and the missing but presumed dead [[Huarwar Mulphoon]]. The aged speaker, [[Dorbulgruf Shalescar]], lived, and could be heard muttering [[Ol Bitey]]'s song.)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for [[Lonelywood]], [[Iriskree Harrowhill]] had been sent by [[Nimsy Huddle]]. Iriskee was lauded as a hero. The scrimshaw shop owner was once a famed assassin. She had protected the town from a small contingent of duergar single-handedly. In good news, a missing woman had been found. [[Vurnis]], the granddaughter of [[Old Huntsman Clive]], was alive and well.)
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon Speaking for [[Good Mead]] was actually Speaker [[Edgra Durmoot]] of [[Dougan's Hole]]. Nobody ever went to Dougan's Hole, so when they saw the skywritten warnings, they went north to the fight themselves. Good Mead owes them ten times over, she boasted! [[Olivessa Untapoor]] sent her thanks along with a cask of ale for the feast.)

## Chosen of Auril

- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon #TheChosen Singers, clad in snow-white fur gowns, took to the stage. Their harmonies were difficult to discern, but a several verses were picked up. *Ice kissed flowers caught mid-bloom/Beauty kept in all its grace/Summer's gone to its silent tomb/Stilling in her cold embrace*. These were worshipers of [[Auril]]. While many Dalefolk looked on in common interest, several were seen reaching into snow banks and anointing their faces. *Sovereign of summers lost/General of winter's war/Long live the queen of cold and frost/May she reign forevermore.* Praising the frostmaiden, especially on a winter holiday, very well falls in line with the traditions and religiosity of the region. But the party was unnerved. After the carols ended, the singers were seen speaking excitedly to a hooded woman. Turning to the side, the fair skinned face of [[Vurnis]], once thought dead was seen.)
- (x:: #TheChosen The singers moved up the northern streets of [[Bryn Shander]], away from the main crowds of the market. [[Fern]] and [[Crank]] quickly and quietly worked through the crowd, the rest of the party in tow, to catch up with [[Vurnis]]. They found her brushing snow off a child's face, near a small family's shrine to [[Auril]]. At first they beat around the bush, but then Crank had enough. "Aren't you dead?" )
- (x:: #FeastOfTheMoon [[Hooked Knucklehead]]. [[Fern]] went shopping. .)
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden #Kulduhar [[Azgul]] and [[Oona]] spoke with [[Vellynne Harpell]])
- (x:: #Kulduhar Refugees came by [[Hooked Knucklehead]])
