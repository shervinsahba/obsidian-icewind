## Caves of Hunger
- (x:: The party approached the [[Tower of Conjuration]], the school of magic known for creating substance from the Weave and summoning creatures through it. The outskirts, in an neat radius about the tower's base, was oddly full of debris. Tossing a stone towards the building, they awaited and soon saw an animated broom come down to sweep the debris. [[Fern]] tried to grab hold of the broom to borrow a lift towards the top of the tower, but the household object was not strong enough. Thus the party approached the door, which upon approach clanked loudly, as an iron mechanism barred the entrance. Using her mage hand, Fern attempted to pick it from a distance causing a bonfire spell to singe the threshold. After some pacing back and forth, noticing the lock would shut upon their departure, Fern attempted to open the door at a far distance. It worked.)
- (x:: Heading towards the prison where [[Xerophun]]'s friend and accomplice was supposedly kept, the party threaded through the dark, mazelike halls of the prison. Frozen corpses dotted ruined cells. In what appeared to be an infirmary, an invisible figure was strapped to a gurney. Fighting off shadows and sorrowsworn, they soon determined this to be [[Supaphun| Xerophun's accomplice]]. They were wreathed in a sequester spell, suspending their state for all these centuries. Debating on the doppelganger's intentions and usefulness, they decided to leave the being within their sequester.)
