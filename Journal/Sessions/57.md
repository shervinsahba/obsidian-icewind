## Caves of Hunger
- (x:: The party approached the [[Tower of Conjuration]], the school of magic known for creating substance from the Weave and summoning creatures through it. The outskirts, in an neat radius about the tower's base, was oddly full of debris. Tossing a stone towards the building, they awaited and soon saw an animated broom come down to sweep the debris. [[Fern]] tried to grab hold of the broom to borrow a lift towards the top of the tower, but the household object was not strong enough. Thus the party approached the door, which upon approach clanked loudly, as an iron mechanism barred the entrance. Using her mage hand, Fern attempted to pick it from a distance causing a bonfire spell to singe the threshold. After some pacing back and forth, noticing the lock would shut upon their departure, Fern attempted to open the door at a far distance. It worked.)
- (x:: Inside the [[Tower of Conjuration]], a lavish feast was set up in a cozy antechamber. A familiar, which the party later noticed changed every minute, was in a cage near a glowing door. [[Crank]] and [[Tetro]] took bites from the heroes' feast, which seemed to have a bit of everything other than knucklehead trout, while[[Gadget]] investigated an intriguing chest that turned out to be an *abracadabrus*.)
- (x:: The glowing door took [[Oona]] and [[Tetro]] to another level of the tower, a level which housed an ice devil or *gelugon* entrapped in a magic circle. Its magic faded for the next minute, after which the others joined. In this new room, which seemed to be a study, an incredibly ornate desk appeared to house some secrets. Dispelling its magic, Tetro found it full of treasures and the second hint of the Rite of the Octad: "Second, summon a flame in the palm of your hand." After this the party turned their attention to some glowing buttons and a second door.)
- (x:: The second door in the [[Tower of Conjuration]] led to a pocket dimension with a vacant grassy field and the banks of a small beach. The ground was indented as if the foundations of a large building once rested here. Returning back and eyeing the ice devil, the party actually spoke to it for the first time. [[Zelzivif]] sneered at the tiefling in infernal. "Not the one," he said, but he went on wondering whether he could strike a deal. He would aid the party, of which he seemed to know an awful lot about, in return for freedom. Not finding this in their best interest, the party kept up the dialogue but did not free the devil, a servant of [[Levistus]]. Though they did briefly consider recruiting him for their chain lightning team. "No matter," he said. "He would be free in his due time.")
- (x:: The buttons on the wall matched the form of the changing familiar. It took a bit of distant sight, with [[Fern]] using [[Jarnathan the familiar|Jarnathan]] to watch the changes of the familiar downstairs, but keying in the correct sequence caused a shift in the pocket dimension. Entering it now led them to [[High Conjurer Damorith]]'s [[Magnificent Mansion]], whose surly, buff butler [[Dudley Eugene]] tended. While Dudley was briefly shocked that his sparring partner was likely dead after a millenia, he was more in tune with keeping house. The mansion was well-appointed for our heroes, who rested after drawing baths.)
- (x:: Heading towards the prison where [[Xerophun]]'s friend and accomplice was supposedly kept, the party threaded through the dark, mazelike halls of the prison. Frozen corpses dotted ruined cells. In what appeared to be an infirmary, an invisible figure was strapped to a gurney. Fighting off shadows and sorrowsworn, they soon determined this to be [[Supaphun| Xerophun's accomplice]]. They were wreathed in a sequester spell, suspending their state for all these centuries. Debating on the doppelganger's intentions and usefulness, they decided to leave the being within their sequester.)
- (x:: Ythryn's main library was nearby. Here they came across the fox-like [[Scrivenscry]] and his blind, albino penguin companion [[Kingsport]]. They had arrived a few days prior via *plane shifting*. Scrivenscry was seeking a *Book of Keeping*, a tome that housed the true names of yugoloth demons. Mistaking the party for librarians, he sent them to fetch the tome while badgering Kingsport to keep up with his duties. Finding Scrivenscry aloof, possibly dangerous, and downright peculiar, the party did do some searching. They wanted to know what the hell a yugoloth was. In one text, [[Tetro]] found sub-types, including the animalistic, covetous, selfish arcanaloth... a type of demon of which Scrivenscry appeared to match. Soon after this a tome golem attacked. When an errant codex bashed into Scrivenscry, its magic swapped its own body with that of poor Kingsport. The two way battle turned into a three way fight, as [[Tetro]] jumped the arcanoloth. While no party member could see this interaction, the arcanaloth attempted to pull *polymorph* from our druid's mind and turn it on its wielder. But Scrivenscry failed to convert. [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] yelled out to spare him, as the arcanaloth tried to make a deal to teach her higher magics. They party wouldn't have it, melting the fiend into ichor and sending him back to the planes of Gehenna. Kingsport was rescued, and seems to be a cool, if perhaps gullible, dude.)
