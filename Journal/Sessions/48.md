## Grimskalle's Gateway to the Four Winds
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden  #TheChosen The heroes stepped into the Trial of Cruelty and soon were transported to a white, nearly featureless area. There was one doorway, and on it was the face of the [[Auril|Cold Crone]]. One eye was missing. Along the walls were some objects, and on approach [[Oona]] saw them to be daggers of ice. [[Gadget]] held a grim expression on her face. [[Tetro]] glanced at her and nodded. The passage seemed to require a sacrifice, and he offered for them to use his own. [[Crank]] shook his head. That wouldn't be cruel of him to offer up his own, now would it? He looked over at [[Vellynne]], who was standing further back from him than he remembered. There was no way in hell she would give hers up without a fight. [[Fern]] grew pensive. [[Oona]] said fuck all that and took out the heart of [[The Endurance]] from their bag of holding. The group startled when they saw her arm drenched with humours, the heart grizzly with newly regrown vascular structure. She shoved it into the socket anyway, but it didn't take. It had to be an eye. Tetro held out stones for the heroes to draw lots. Crank came up short. Oona held him down as Tetro approached with the knife, the others drawing on their skills to aid Tetro's hand or still those of Crank. Oona spoke to soothe the bugbear as he suffered his lot. With the eye removed, Tetro placed it within the door, and they were brought back to [[Grimskalle]]. All but Oona received the glyph of cruelty.)
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden  For the Trial of Endurance, the party appeared in the middle of a snowstorm. The spellcasters quickly noted that some antimagic presence was at hand. In the near distance, the [[Tribe of the Elk]] was hurried to dismantle their camp and move from the surroundings. [[Jarund Elkheart]], their chief, called out to the party, to Auril's emissaries, with caution. He claimed their tribe was being persecuted with impossible conditions and a lack of game. Auril's winter, he said, was out to kill them. But they must endure. The party aided the Elk on a grueling march with the Elk to seek better conditions. While all the party members made it through, only a handful received the glyph of endurance upon reappearing in [[Grimskalle]].)
- (x:: #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden Our heroes had caught a knucklehead trout during the Trial of Endurance, which [[Ukuma]] was THRILLED to see.)
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden  Trial of Preservation. [[Aerix]])
