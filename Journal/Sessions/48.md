## Grimskalle's Gateway to the Four Winds
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden  #TheChosen The heroes stepped into the Trial of Cruelty and soon were transported to a white, nearly featureless area. There was one doorway, and on it was the face of the [[Auril|Cold Crone]]. One eye was missing. Along the walls were some objects, and on approach [[Oona]] saw them to be daggers of ice. [[Gadget]] held a grim expression on her face. [[Tetro]] glanced at her and nodded. The passage seemed to require a sacrifice, and he offered for them to use his own. [[Crank]] shook his head. That wouldn't be cruel of him to offer up his own, now would it? He looked over at [[Vellynne]], who was standing further back from him than he remembered. There was no way in hell she would give hers up without a fight. [[Fern]] grew pensive. [[Oona]] said fuck all that and took out the heart of [[The Endurance]] from their bag of holding. The group startled when they saw her arm drenched with humours, the heart grizzly with newly regrown vascular structure. She shoved it into the socket anyway, but it didn't take. It had to be an eye. Tetro held out stones for the heroes to draw lots. Crank came up short. Oona held him down as Tetro approached with the knife, the others drawing on their skills to aid Tetro's hand or still those of Crank. Oona spoke to soothe the bugbear as he suffered his lot. With the eye removed, Tetro placed it within the door, and they were brought back to Grimskalle. All but Oona received the glyph of cruelty.)
