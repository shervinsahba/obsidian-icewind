## Grimskalle's Gateway to the Four Winds
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden  The heroes stepped into the Trial of Cruelty and soon were transported to a white, nearly featureless area. There was one doorway, on it face of the [[Auril|Cold Crone]]. One eye was missing. Along the walls were some objects, and on approach [[Oona]] saw them to be daggers of ice. [[Gadget]] and [[Vellynne]] were in thought with grim expressions on their face. It clicked to [[Tetro]], the passage required a sacrifice. He volunteered his eye. )
- (x::  #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden  Trial of Endurance.)
