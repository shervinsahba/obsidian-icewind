summary: Making Friends in Good Mead

## On the road eastward
- (x:: The party left [[Targos]] the dawn after dispatching [[Sephek Kaltro]] before news about the scuffle at the warehouse spread. They decided to head to [[Easthaven]] to follow [[Arcane Brotherhood]] activities as well as pursue several quest leads in the paper. Notably, they deduced [[Cora Mulphoon]]'s lost son [[Huarwar Mulphoon|Huarwar]], who was last seen with shady figures, may be located in the sanctuary stronghold of [[Caer Dineval]] or ruins of [[Caer Konig]].)
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller Passing through [[Bryn Shander]], [[Fern]] kept her hood up, perceiving a wanted poster describing a duo of tiefling and bugbear dog thieves. Seeking [[Hlin Trollbane]], the bounty huntress who hired them weeks prior to find the killer, the party, less Fern, went to Town Hall. Here [[Markham Southwell|Sheriff Southwell]] greeted them. Trollbane had given the sheriff the bounty to dole out to the adventurers... which he would have granted if [[Hazel]] didn't let slip that she was friend with the dog thieves. Deception failed, the two parties agreed to let the payment slide and call it all water under the bridge.)
- (x:: The party visited [[Kadu's Wondrous Scrolls]] and met the aloof proprietor [[Kadu]], a bespectacled gnome who dealt in scrolls for the plane shifting wizarding world. [[Azgul]] took note of her disarray, and she admitted to be frantically searching for a copy of *Scroll of Plane Shift*, already missing her summer vacation. Kadu offered her scroll crafting services to the group.)

## Making friends in Good Mead
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow [[Good Mead]]'s ever dwindling supply of honey ale just didn't sit right with the party. Between the righteousness of beer and a possible [[Zhentarim]] replacement for their Town Hall speaker, the party hoofed it to the town. On arrival, though small in stature, the village was literally buzzing from the ice bees in the main mead hall. Here they met [[Olivessa Untapoor]], eldest cask-maker of the town's Chultan families. Oli woefully admitted that she was indeed running for speaker, ever since [[Kendrick Rielsbarrow]] had been speared to death when a verbeeg assaulted the town and stole three casks. Kendrick's corpse was laid down for mourning in the Shrine of the Flaming Sword, an aged local hall once dedicated to Tempus.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow The opposition to [[Olivessa Untapoor]] was a relative newcomer to the village, a brusque red-haired dwarf and logger named [[Shandar Froth]]. Shandar had relocated to Good Mead only a couple years back from [[Mirabar]], a wealthy mining city south of the Spine of the World. The party found him near the logging lodges, and, while gruff, Shandar put his foot down that he is running because he needs to... and that the town needs a leader too, damnit. The insightful [[Tetro]] felt there was truth to his words, but that a bit more remained unsaid.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow The verbeeg was last sighted in the northern woods and a search party had gone missing. Heading to the forest, the party ran into [[Fef Morwyn]], a terrified scout. Fef had found the search party: the lot of them clubbed to death in a grove. Following the large footsteps at the scene, the party found a cave network, part of which was connected to indigenous ruins and crypts.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow Stealthily moving through the cave, [[Fern]] managed to cast *Charm Person* on the verbeeg, who was named [[Duhg]]. "Fern is friend, right Duhg?" "Oh yeah, totally friend." "Fern can see the casks of mead, yes?" "Oh yes. Yes. I have casks, come partake!" "Duhg, I'm the only friend here, correct?" "Only Friend is here!" As Fern followed Duhg into the cave with the party a fair distance behind, several goats bleated. "Duhg took these from a farmer. He's dead now! Ha ha!")
