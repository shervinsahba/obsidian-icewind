description: "Returning from the Caves of Hunger, the nearest tower of magic belonged to the school of abjuration. A symbol of insanity glyph warded the entrance, which sent Oona running amok into a collection of buildings were magen guards were fought. When clarity settled, the party entered the tower, dealing with arcane locked doors and further defenses until they came across the school's prized possession: the anvil of disjunction. The sentient item hungered to be fed. A glass cabinet with crystal-trapped figurines stood nearby. Feeding the anvil one did not sate it, but did release a trapped man, Xerophun. Not trusting the sallow man, Crank jabbed a spear into his foot, causing him to shapeshift rapidly: a doppelganger. His story was that he and another shapeshifting friend were caught posing as high magisters -- a crime or a path to freedom? In any case, the party sacrificed a staff to the anvil, revealed a second cryptic instruction. Xerophun elaborated that this was a stage of the Rite of the Octad, a graduation for mages who wish to enter the central Spire of Iriolarthas. The talk was cut short, as the burst of weave energy from the anvil's use drew a tomb tapper towards the building. Fleeing from the grotesque construct, Xerophun stumbled due to his lame foot. As the party escaped, the doppelganger, released after an eternity in his spell-wrought prison, was gnashed in the maw of the faceless sentry."
