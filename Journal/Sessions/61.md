## Tower of Divination
- (x:: On the top floor of the [[Tower of Divination]] the party took in the arcane brass telescope of the observatory near a sphere full of eyes and viscera, the desiccated corpse of the [[High Diviner Apius]], and the dying body of [[Azgul]] torn open from the swarm of nothics. Applying pressure, [[Oona]] kept Azgul alive somewhat longer in for the party to investigate. When pressed on why he left, he admitted that he thought he was better able to pursue the treasures of Ythryn alone. When pressed about the Arcane Brotherhood, he noted that [[Avarice]] was present in Ythryn and [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] had evidently lost her mind. They noted his eye was missing, but the wound appeared old. When asked if he lost it using the telescope, he said he didn't get the chance due to the nothic mob. When asked about his famed *eyes of the eagle* goggles, he laughed and coughed up blood. As the party talked over what may or may not have occurred, Azgul went into and out of consciousness. His dying words were "THAT BASTARD TOOK IT ON THE ISLAND!" Oona took a lock of his hair as a memento.)
- (x:: Investigating [[High Diviner Apius]]'s scattered texts, the party had difficulty understanding the language, but noted a repeated footnote referencing Apius's spellbook. This book, however, appeared to be missing. [[Gadget]]'s deduction about the telescope, the diviner's corpse, and the vat of eyes told her that Apius had burnt her eyes out in the use of the device, which appeared to be drenched in divination magic to act as a stronger version of the scry spell. It could locate most anything, most anywhere at a risk to one's own vision. The diviner's corpse, however, had a pristine cloak on: a *cloak of eyes* that she presumably used to counter this lost of sight. Moving towards the scope, [[Fern]] went to peer into the apparatus, when the diviner's dead hand reached out to grasp her. All were pulled into an intensely powerful trap, a pocket dimension of sorts where Apius fought against the intruders again and again, redefining THIS FUTURE to a new state. It was a battle of attrition, as the party fought back to resurface from the spell. Fern was then finally able to use the telescope, scouring Ythryn for Apius's spellbook. She saw it in the hands of [[Huarwar Mulphoon]], walking towards the arboretum with a cadre of [[Black Swords]]. Fern managed to keep her own eyes intact.)

## Arboretum
- (x:: [[Arboretum]] to find Apius's spellbook, the party goes to the glass dome of the [[Arboretum]] where they encounter [[Huarwar]] and the [[Black Swords]]. The cult members are quietly attempting to carve bark from the Nether Oak that rests dormant in the center. The heroes decide to take advantage of stealth with [[Fern]] sneaking through some brush to mage hand the spellbook of [[High Diviner Apius]] out of Huarwar's pack and [[Tetro]] crawling up the dome as a spider. The Black Swords were unable to carve the Nether Oak's bark without awakening the treant, who decided to toy with them and attack. This soon turned into a three way battle as [[Crank]] ambushed a Knight of Levistus. While Huarwar tried to compel the party to team up against the oak, the party realized they had the initiative to take both opponents down. Oona put down an irate Huarwar and two Black Swords cultists fled while the heroes put an end to the evil treant, recovering bark to carve a wand for the Rite of the Octad in the process.)
