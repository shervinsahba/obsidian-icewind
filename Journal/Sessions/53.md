## Caves of Hunger
- (x::  #TheCavesOfHunger #TheChosen [[Tekeli-li]] had changed into a mist and crept into the fissures of the glacial ice, now a deeper blue that the opaque whites near the frozen waterfall. [[Professor Skant|Skant]] marveled at the ferociousness of the vampire -- surely an ancient being -- and prattled on about their typical weaknesses. Perfumes. The Celestial tongue. And, of course, sunlight. [[Tetro]] had caught up to the party by this point.)
- (x:: Descending further into the caves, the party members began seeing, smelling, or just *feeling* things. [[Oona]] could not seem to shake off a scent. It reminded her of a difficult day in her past, but which day she could not put her finger on. Soon the party entered a hall of ice sculptures. [[Fern]] froze and clutched a dagger. Were they alive, wondered [[Gadget]]. But these were crude things. It took a second of staring, but they sort of looked like kobolds. Very poorly carved kobolds. [[Crank]] sent the arcane eye he picked up from the Ythryn tourist board to scout. While appearing empty at first glance, the next chamber held a party of kobolds, all clinging to the walls like spiders. Vampire spawn. The party decided to blitz them. A few blows in and [[Tetro]] unleashed a daylight spell, engulfing the kobolds in flame. The heroes made short work of two more, but several scattered. A quick chase led to a larger brawl in a chamber filled with snow golems. When the dust settled, all but one of the kobolds was dead. The survivor had scuttled away. The eerie quiet of the cave set in.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger #TheChosen Still deeper, the party found the lair of kobold gang. In the center stood a crystalline column of ice. It was cracked open, revealing a void inside. Surrounding it appeared to be offerings. Bones and such. An altar of sorts. Upon examination, several shards of ice hovered in the air. [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] couldn't help but wonder whether the Rime Poem shattered more than the frozen waterfall. It may have opened this vessel. The party gazed at the icy coffin and knew then that it once held [[Tekeli-li]], the isolated.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger The remains of a frost giant -- well preserved -- law underneath the floor of a cloistered cave on the edge of the cavern. Several claw marks, likely from the kobolds, showed a futile effort to exhume the corpse. Curious but wary, the party chose to speak to the dead through [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]]'s necromancy. [[Tetro]] shaped just enough water away to reveal its head only. They learned of [[Vlagomir]], the dragon hunter. He and his mammoth were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were traversing the heights of [[Reghed Glacier]] when [[Ythryn]] fell. He was crushed by the city and buried within the ice. Contemplating his story, someone asked "Was that five questions yet?" when the giant replied "Yes" and returned to the world of death.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger A dark, hissing wraith awaited in a terminating branch of the caves. Behind him were, through frozen walls of ice, were some objects embedded in glacial cysts. [[Professor Skant]] took on the mantle of translator, bringing the restless Netherese spirit in communication with the party. "Cursed be those who gaze  upon the horror that [[Drakareth]] has become. Such promise wasted, lost in this cold sepulcher! Where were you centuries ago when he was in his prime of life? Where were you when the frigid darkness consumed him? You are no good to Drakareth now. Nothing remains of him but frozen bones, ancient treasure, and me."  It appeared that this wraith was once a survivor of[[Ythryn]]'s fall. He attempted to flee the ruins with his treasure and failed. The party snuffed the undead menace and raided his belongings. A *mantle of spell resist* went to [[Oona]], while [[Tetro]] began attuning to a *staff of charming*. The tortle felt bolder. Bossy, even!)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger Traversing further into the ice, the band eyed another remorhaz tunnel dropping precipitously into the deep. They suppressed their itching curiosity and made it through a tight passage within which a different horror awaited. Something large and dark writhed behind a towering, frosted wall of ice. The presence grew stronger as they tried to sidle past through a narrowing passage, visually and mentally looming. Suddenly, the searching they felt in their minds whirled and seized hold of their memories.  [[[Gadget]] winced and lilted. [[Fern]]'s eyes shut. [[Oona]] was in a standing stupor. And [[Vellynne Harpell]] jaw went slack. [[Crank]] and [[Tetro]] grimaced through the mental barrage and quickly dragged and heaved the others away from the thing in the ice. They knew what the monster was now and roughly what was transpriring. Like the [[30|ossified creature under the Sussur Tree]], this was a [[Phaerimm|phaerimm]]. Their minds were dominated.)
- (x:: #TheCavesOfHunger [[Gadget]]'s childhood was a warm one, standing beside her sister in her father's workshop. Learning to tinker. Hoping to event. WALK. [[Tetro]] used the command spell to hopefully break through the phaerimm's grip. [[Oona]]'s adolescence in Ten Towns was happy. Though she was hardened by the snow, she was ready for a new life. She used her strength and candor to begin her work in massage. WALK, Tetro boomed, while [[Crank]] sat his companions down gingerly. [[Fern]] cracked her knuckles. She was older, more accomplished. This job was routine. Maybe it was time to retire. She wondered how her son was at academy. WALK. The three adventurers returned from their dreams into the glacial blue world of the caves. [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] eyes fluttered through her life. WALK. She did not open them then. As the minutes passed, the room began to fill with mist. The gnoll vampire would be close.)
