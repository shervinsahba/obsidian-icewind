summary: The Caves of Hunger
saga: Reghed Glacier
description: The party approached Reghed Glacier. Elk scouts warned them of Queen Bjornhild of the Tiger Tribe, though Oona sought an audience regardless. Declaring to the clan that her birth daughter not only survived but had slain dragons and braved the Sea of Ice, the party assuaged the queen to stand down. Crank recited the Rime of the Frostmaiden and shattered the ice holding the frozen waterfall together. And thus the party entered the Caves of Hunger. Within the glacial depths, they found the road was a graveyard littered with the remnants of Ythryn fall... and of creatures who bloomed or doomed themselves alongside it. Soon the party found themselves stalked by a gnoll vampire... Tekeli-li, the Hunger of Isolation.
