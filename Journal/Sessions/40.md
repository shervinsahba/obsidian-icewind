## Kuldahar
- (x:: #Kulduhar The Great Oak of [[Kuldahar]] jutted out of the misty mountaintops of the [[Spine of the World]]. As our heroes approached the gates of [[Kuldahar]], the temperature pulled back from the biting cold to a pleasant warmth. The snows were visible far overhead and to their backs, but the aura emanating from the Great Oak caused nearly all signs of winter to dissipate within its canopy. Several bands of Ten Towns refugees had already made it to the gates, where a hubbub was brewing. The gates were closed to the travelers. Some talk with the guards brought the party into the village and before the Druidic Counsel, who were meeting about this very situation.)
