## Kuldahar
- (x:: #Kulduhar The Great Oak of [[Kuldahar]] jutted out of the misty mountaintops of the [[Spine of the World]]. As our heroes approached the gates, the temperature pulled back from the biting cold to a pleasant warmth. The snows were visible far overhead and to their backs, but the aura emanating from the Great Oak caused nearly all signs of winter to dissipate within its canopy. The power of Kuldahar's Great Oak lied within the *heartstone gem*, an artifact said to be a seed bestowed by Silvanus himself, which lay at the pedestal within the heart of the tree. Several bands of Ten Towns refugees had already made it to the gates, which were closed to the travelers causing a hubbub. Some talk with the guards led to the party's entrance into the village to negotiate the refugee situation. They were to be led to the Druidic Counsel, who were in session about this very situation.)
- (x:: #Kulduhar On the way to the [[Kuldahar#Counsel Chambers|Counsel Chambers]], the party saw the various workshops, taverns, and inns of the druidic enclave. Several worshipers were praying to a statue of Silvanus in the center of the enclave, below which were effigies of the founders of Kuldahar, archdruids long gone. The guards noted that the current archdruid was [[Iselore]], a green haired elf who had seen the village through the past hundred years, including a troubling time when the village was attacked. This attack stemmed from outsiders taking advantage of ancient Yuan-Ti temples underneath the roots of the Great Oak, which existed long before the tree was a sapling. This holy site had been a wellspring of magical potency for eons it seemed.)
- (x:: #Kulduhar The Druidic Counsel sat around a long wooden table, intricate carvings and rootwork ornamentation embellishing the room. [[Iselore]] was fielding suggestions from various counsel heads, amongst the two dozen or so individuals in the room. The old elf was hesitant about permitting outsiders inside the enclave, given troubles in the past and simple logistical issues. An aasimar woman named [[Eirys]] balked at this, exemplifying the merits of her decades long sanctuary at [[Kuldahar]] and championed for the refugees to be accepted into the haven. Iselore had not been outside the walls of Kuldahar in quite some time, Eirys complained. She did not understand the winter. The party decided to bolster this point, describing [[Auril]]'s Eternal Winter and the recent assault on Ten Towns by the [[Xardorok Sunblight]] and his [[Chardalyn Dragon]]. The counsel put forth the decision to a vote, which narrowly came in favor of allowing the refugees solace. Iselore, while not pleased, accepted the outcome.)
- (x:: #Kulduhar [[Oona]] and [[Tetro]] noticed a strange druid eavesdropping at the fringe of the counsel chambers. He startled at the discussion of the Eternal Winter, and bolted into the courtyards, muttering to himself. Following him, they met [[Keeper]], which was more of a title than name for he was the one who tended to the [[Kuldahar#Shrine of the Heartstone Gem|Shrine of the Heartstone Gem]]. He insisted that something was amiss with the Greak Oak, but that, well, he needed evidence. He seemed to be wary of trusting the counselors and wished the heroes to meet him at the shrine to help investigate.)
- (x:: #Kulduhar The party spent some time around [[Kuldahar]]. [[Crank]] spent some time at the [[Kuldahar#Root Cellar|Root Cellar]], a tavern in a defunct airship at the edge, where [[Eirys]] thanked the party for their efforts in bringing the Ten Towners into the haven.  [[Azgul]] and [[Gadget]] checked out the laboratory of a gnomish herbalist, [[Oswald Fiddlebender]], whose had a decent stock of potions which they picked through. [[Fern]], [[Oona]], and [[Tetro]] went to a wizard's tower, where a masked half-orc mage named [[Orrick]] offered to sell them some of his old belongings. When [[Tetro]] spotted a *Belt of Dwarvenkind*, he had to have it, 3000 gold cost be damned.)
