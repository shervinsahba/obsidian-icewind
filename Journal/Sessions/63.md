summary: Iriolarthas, Archmage of the Ebon Star
saga: Ythryn
description: "Pushing through eight devil-trapped corridors, the party entered an atreum with eight empty chairs and the glimmering vision of the cosmos, all of the skies plus one eerie dark red star. Inside a sealed library panel, opened by the phrase EBON STAR, the party found a legendary Scroll of the Comet. In a stasis chamber, they came close to The Spindle, the mysterious Ostorian artifact that nullified all magic within Ythryn and caused it to fall from the skies a thousand years ago. By solving the riddle of the eight chairs, the adventurers opened a portal to the demilich Iriolarthas's study. Here they fought the mad Netherese wizard, rending open a living demiplane and combating his reinforcements within. Defeating the demilich - thus severing his attunement to the Mythallar below - they quickly raided his room. They claimed another legendary scroll, one that could summon The Tarrasque. And on Iriolarthas's desk laid his Staff of Power, an item that both Veneranda and Avarice sought: The Netherese brain wished to use it at the Obelisk to turn back time on the city. And Avarice? Who knows. But receiving the staff was her term to aid against the Frostmaiden."
