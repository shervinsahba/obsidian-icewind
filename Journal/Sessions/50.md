summary: Return to Ten Towns
saga: Reghed Glacier
description: The party returns from Solstice Island and heads through Ten Towns as premonitions of Auril's Eternal Winter begin to manifest. They stop in the ruins of Bremen, parlay for potions with Naerth in Targos, and patiently listened through the misadventures of T-Rex and Copper at the Hooked Knucklehead in Bryn Shander. Here they convene with the Elk King's shaman, Mjenir, from whom they receive visions of the frozen waterfall at the Evermelt... and of troubles on the road ahead. The party makes one last detour in Easthaven, heading onto the ice of Lac Dinneshere to delve for the wreckage of the Howling Wind. They fight coldlight harpies and find treasure, as well as the abberant body of the White Lady herself.

## Return to Ten Towns
- (x::  #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden Recuperating at [[Angajuk's Bell]], several sensitive folk approach them with visions of dreams. Dreams of endless night. Dreams of icing death. Dreams of a storm descending on Icewind Dale like nothing before. Looking out into the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], the chill in the air begins manifest. Dawn seems to falter.)
- (x:: #TenTownsThings The party takes their sleds into Ten Towns for a final visit before setting out to [[Reghed Glacier]] to use to Codicil of White. Coming into the ruins of [[Bremen]] they note of quite little left. Five Tavern Center is a pile of rubble, though some settlers are clearing the ash. Buried Treasures, the inn belonging to [[Cora Mulphoon]], is gone. Its sign lay grimed in the sleet and ash. Its owner is no more. In [[Targos]], [[Crank]] uses his sway with [[Naerth Maxildannar]] to procure various healing and resistance potions. A bit of insight shows that Naerth no longer sees his boy Crank as a pawn. He sees him as a threat.)
- (x:: #TenTownsThings At [[Bryn Shander#The Hooked Knucklehead|Bryn's Hooked Knucklehead]], the party arrives only to clear out some rabble from their own tavern. [[T-Rex]] -- now wearing a top hat -- has been dealing with some "really cool dudes" including a guy named [[Lefty]]. This has been a resounding success for the tavern in all the wrong ways. T-Rex may or may not be involved in gang activity, and may or may not realize the issue. He has been telling you all about it on the sending stone, or the "talky rocky" as he calls it. But as it turns out [[Copper]] swapped it out with an ordinary rock a while ago.)
- (x:: #WreckOfLacDinneshere #battle [[Crank]] has never let go the shipwreck in [[Lac Dinneshere]]. This would be the remains of the Howling Wind whose chardalyn figurehead drove its sailors mad ten years ago. Making their way onto the ice, the party divines the location. They fight off some coldlight harpies, a dread sign of the coming deepwinter. Crank, [[Tetro]], and [[Oona]] dive in the murky waters while [[Fern]] and [[Gadget]] remain on shore. While the divers manage to find a lockbox in the deep, those above water begin hearing an eerie rhyme across the waters. It's the poem of the [[White Lady]]. Worrying for those below, they peer into the water only for the aberrated body of White Lady to plunge outwards. Her weirding glare begins to simultaneously horrify and sap the life out of them, but the team puts her down. The bulk of her being withers into the skeletal remains of her former self, finally at rest. For now.)
