summary: Temple of the Four Gods
saga: Sea of Moving Ice
description: Our heroes made preparations at Angajuk's Bell before diving into the shallows of the Sea of Moving Ice aboard Angajuk. They entered the Temple of the Four Gods, where they were tested by both sahuagin priestesses and warriors as well as a trial in a chamber devoted to Umberlee, the Wavemother. Fighting towards a chamber dedicated to Malar, Crank was bitten by a wereshark and subjected to the curse of lycanthrophy.

## Angajuk's Bell
- (x::  #KrakenClimateArena Resting at [[Angajuk's Bell]], the local fishermen took notice of our heroes preparing for their venture to the [[Temple of the Four Gods]]. They outfitted members with javelins and nets, and a Reghed crafter furnished one of [[Crank]]'s Remorhaz trophies into a [[Homebrew Items#Remorhaz Spear|Remorhaz Javelin]]. )

## Temple of the Four Gods
- (x::  #battle #FourGodsofFury The party discovered a hidden passage to an orca pool behind the temple. Fighting their way in, they crept around a great hall and swam into a chamber dedicated to the wave mother, [[Umberlee]]. Soon after, they faced battle against sahuagin priestesses who caught the blood scent of the intruders and deemed them sacrifices.)
- (x::  #FourGodsofFury The chamber of [[Umberlee]] held a magic vortex trap, which when coupled with the debris of the eroded temple, turned into a nasty maelstrom. The heroes discovered that the one who activated the trap was actually being tested on a trial. The reward was a blessing aligned with the deity.)
- (x::  #battle #FourGodsofFury Fighting past several sahuagin coral smashers, the party went down a path marked with the symbol of the beast lord [[Malar]]. In this chamber a lone, deranged sahuagin named Culvier was tending to his kelp gardens and food supply. The room itself showed signs of a recent struggle with claw marks. Aggravating Culvier, the party faced a raging wereshark as the sahuagin transformed. [[Crank]] was bit and afflicted with [[Homebrew Items#Wereshark Lycanthropy|wereshark lycanthropy]] .)
- (x:: #FourGodsofFury Taking a breather in a pocket of air against the ceiling, [[Vellynne Harpell]] shared that she believed this temple to be a [[Netherese|Low Netherese]] construction. Unlike the mages of High Netheril who thought themselves to be above the gods, the Low Netherese were seen as pagan commoners.)
