## Kuldahar
- (x:: #TheDevilYouKnow #Kulduhar After returning from the Yuan-Ti ruins, the party spent several nights recuperating in [[Kuldahar]] preparing for their trek back to Ten Towns. One morning they awoke and [[Azgul]] was not only gone, but the evil druid [[Eirys]] was dead. Either in his haste, out of guilt, or for the future of his comrades, he had left behind the [[Homebrew Items#Great Oak Crystal|Great Oak Crystal]] and [[Homebrew Items#Frostburn Blade|Frostburn Blade]].)

## Bryn Shander
- (x:: #TenTownsThings The journey back to [[Bryn Shander]] was faster without the caravan of Dalefolk refugees. At the [[Hooked Knucklehead]], they were met by [[T-Rex]] and [[Copper]], the latter of whom had been driven batty by the, erm, industrious kobold. It appears that T-Rex grew more enterprising under [[Marta Pekryk]]'s tutelage, so much so that she left. The kobold had found a cache of weapons stored under the floorboards and sold them to some really cool dudes for several barrels of [[Good Mead]]'s good mead. He said they brought over the good stuff from [[Bremen]], which, you know, recently burnt down. [[Tetro]] began detecting for poisons, while [[Crank]] took a sip. It was delicious. After sleuthing around their tavern, the party deduced those really cool dudes must have been Zhentarim smugglers. In any case, T-Rex emptied a coin purse into [[Fern]]'s palm, delivering a profit of 100 gp.)
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden #TheForgottenRealm [[Copper]] fetched [[Vellynne Harpell]], who had also returned from her journeys. With the party retelling the story of [[Kuldahar]], the old wizard nodded and addressed what she believed the state of affairs were. The boundaries between the [[Plane of Ice]] and the locale of the Material Plane surrounding Icewind Dale were thinning. Or, perhaps, merging. It would explain what little word and travelers were seen from the outside, as well as teleportation mishaps, and the appearance of frost salamanders. The move then, was to end [[Auril|the Frostmaiden]]'s endless winter, one way or another. Perhaps [[Ythryn]]'s [[Netherese|mythallar]], its reactor core so to speak, would be able to override or overpower the divine magic - if it were still intact at least. And if not, perhaps the Netherese ruins would provide another avenue out for this frigid wasteland.)
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden #TheForgottenRealm [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] continued to explain her proposal. Together, they could venture to [[Solstice Isle]], the moving isle of [[Auril]] and her cult, and take from within it an incantation from the *Codicil of White*, teachings passed from generation to generation of Frostmaiden worshippers. This incantation was the key, she admitted, to undoing the barrier at [[Reghed Glacier]]. Past the frozen waterfall was where [[Ythryn]] slept, and together they could uncover its secrets. It was win-win, she said.)
- (x:: #TrialsOfTheFrostmaiden Within [[Solstice Isle]] were a series of trials, the nature of which [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] had yet to divine. Seeking out [[Reghed Nomads]], those close to the essence of the tundra, the party found some [[Tribe of the Bear]] traders who mused on their folklore about the cold reality of their ancestry: What may be seen as cruelty to outsiders holds reason in old tribal teachings. What ends you must pursue in order to endure, a city dweller may consider torture. This is the truth of the ice.)
