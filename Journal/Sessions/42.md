## Kuldahar
- (x:: #Kulduhar The party's stay in [[Kuldahar]] [[Iselore]] had been unable to remove the Rime-Kissed Curse from the *Heartstone Gem*. The curse appeared to be bound to a physical item or phylactery, which was slowly leeching the artifact's energy for purposes unknown. Iselore suspected that [[Eirys]] took advantage of the wellsprings of magical potency underneath the [[Kuldahar|Great Oak]] to deploy this curse. She believed a Yuan-Ti ruin, within which a portal had formed decades ago that lead to an attack in Kuldahar, was where the heroes would find answers.)
