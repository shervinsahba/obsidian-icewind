## Cauldron Caves of Lac Dinneshere
- (x:: #battle #ToilAndTrouble The party followed the tracks of the four fisherman along a frozen river into one of four entrances into [[Lac Dinneshere]]'s cliffside until they came across a frozen waterfall about 10 feet in height. [[Hazel]] nimbly climbed up, peering into the darkness to see the frozen waters continuing but also a large stonecarved entrance to her right. She had the party come up, but the ice crumbled under [[Fern]], leading to a battle with a dual headed water weird that broke free and attempted to drag members under.)
- (x:: #ToilAndTrouble The stonecarved walls were glowing blue. [[Tetro]] couldn't identify any fungus or mineral making the effect, curiously enough, but the height and width of the passages suggested of giant origin. Coming to a wider chamber, [[Fern]] snuck ahead. The walls were adorned with ancient flatware and goblets of giant make. )
- (x::  #battle #ToilAndTroubleIn A frost giant skeleton had lain dormant until the remaining party entered the chamber. As it chipped out of the ice to tower over even [[Crank]], [[Hazel]] began to flee northward while [[Azgul]] went south. Eventually a battle ensued with the lugubrious giant landing heavy blows on [[Oona]] before its bones were pulverized.)
- (x:: #ToilAndTrouble Hearing the battle, [[Azgul]] decided to wrap around the frozen river, hoping to find another entrance. After scaling up an icy overpass, he hit a dead end. However, he found an old dwarven explorer's pack along with notes about a madness in these halls and shrill cackles. It seemed the explorer was interested in a burial ground for giants in a hot spring, and it seems they never left.)
- (x:: #ToilAndTrouble The hot springs seemed to be no more. Instead, the cavernous source of the frozen river lay iced over. Down into the glacial blue depths a hundred frost giant corpses remained suspended and lost to time.)
