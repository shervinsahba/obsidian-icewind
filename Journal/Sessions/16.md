## Cauldron Caves of Lac Dinneshere
- (x:: #battle #ToilAndTrouble The party followed the tracks of the four fisherman along a frozen river into one of four entrances into [[Lac Dinneshere]]'s cliffside until they came across a frozen waterfall about 10 feet in height. [[Hazel]] nimbly climbed up, peering into the darkness to see the frozen waters continuing but also a large stonecarved entrance to her right. She had the party come up, but the ice crumbled under [[Fern]], leading to a battle with a dual headed water weird that broke free and attempted to drag members under.)
