## Cauldron Caves of Lac Dinneshere
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow As the party was preparing to leave town, a scuffle broke out at the [[Good Mead]] hall. Several thugs were running away, licking their wounds as [[Shandar Froth]] and his loggers hollered at them to get lost. [[Oona]] grappled a thug.[[Crank]] clotheslined another, picking him up with an arm for questioning. [[Crank]] recognized the Zhentarim flunky, and it was soon revealed that these thugs lost on purpose by the orders of [[Naerth Maxildannar]] to make Shandar look good. With onlookers watching the scene, Shandar was exposed. He admitted to the deception but said he did have the town's interest in heart and that, in truth, the Zhentarim had been blackmailing him to keep his past from catching up. He was a man wanted for murder in [[Mirabar]]. With Shandar outed, it seems [[Olivessa Untapoor]] will become speaker.)
