## Angajuk's Bell
- (x:: #TheDevilYouKnow A dismal, darkening dawn approached the party as [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne's]] tiny hut spell began to wane. While attending to the dog sleds, the group began to wonder what happened to [[Azgul]] and realized they could scry on him with the Great Oak's Amulet. They saw a vision of the warlock eating a salted fish in a dingy homestay before stepping outside into a Ten Towns street. The rubble and ash and paved remnants of the Eastway told them this was [[Easthaven]]. Following Azgul from afar, they saw him meet a shady man with a silver tooth to buy a magical ward with an evil eye on it. Grasping it from the vendor, Azgul immediately cocked his head and their vision utterly vanished. Some discussion later and the party agreed. Azgul had acquired an *amulet of proof against detection*.)
- (x:: #TheFrozenGames Nearing [[Angajuk's Bell]], several more tents than usual were set up. There was a small crowd of people gathering on the ice and at the center was [[Hazel]]. She pushed away her apparent followers to reunite with the party.)
