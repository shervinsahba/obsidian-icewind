## Angajuk's Bell
- (x:: #TheDevilYouKnow A dismal, darkening dawn approached the party as [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne's]] tiny hut spell began to wane. While attending to the dog sleds, the group began to wonder what happened to [[Azgul]] and realized they could scry on him with the Great Oak's Amulet. They saw a vision of the warlock eating a salted fish in a dingy homestay before stepping outside into a Ten Towns street. The rubble and ash and paved remnants of the Eastway told them this was [[Easthaven]]. Following Azgul from afar, they saw him meet a shady man with a silver tooth to buy a magical ward with an evil eye on it. Grasping it from the vendor, Azgul immediately cocked his head and their vision utterly vanished. Some discussion later and the party agreed. Azgul had acquired an *amulet of proof against detection*.)
- (x:: #TheFrozenGames As their sleds approached [[Angajuk's Bell]] several more tents than usual were set up. There was a small crowd of people gathering on the ice and at the center was [[Hazel]]. She pushed away her apparent followers to reunite with the party. During the past months she had first grown meditative, recalling fragment memories of her past life as Anga, and then had grown... bored. To pass the time, Hazel brought Monk University energy to practices of endurance, isolation, and preservation. In short, she created a winter game series. And as fishers, traders, and Reghed came to the seaside enclave, word quickly spread.)
- (x:: #TheDevilYouKnow #KrakenClimate Among the pilgrims and competitors at [[Hazel]]'s Frozen Games were a set of familiar faces from the [[Black Swords]]: the brooding Levistus-sworn [[Huarwar Mulphoon]], the gangly obsequious [[Thoob]], and the lost servant girl[[Mere]]. Thoob was stupidly enamored with the games, while Huarwar brooded by their camp. They didn't seem surprised to see the party at present. Hazel noted that the Levistus troupe had arrived recently led by Huarwar. He mostly kept his distance after exchanging a cut but civil greeting, while the others were only slightly more talkative. They all had occasionally left camp to trek up and down the coast. As she was describing this, Mere was stealing glances at the party.)
- (x:: #TheFrozenGames Hazel's entourage grew restless. A call to games was announced. Each member of the party competed in feats of strength and dexterity: the Ice Run, the Poalr Plunge, the Mammoth Toss, the Snowball Duel, and the Ice Climb. These were clearly games designed by a Monk U alumni. Competitors included Huarwar, Thoob, and several Reghedfolk. In the distance [[Tinjong]], the elderly fisherman who once housed them here at [[Angajuk's Bell]], sighed and shook his head at the spectacle. [[Crank]] took first place while [[Fern]] and [[Tetro]] tied for second, just beating a sullen [[Huarwar Mulphoon]].)
- (x:: #TheDevilYouKnow Retiring to [[Hazel]]'s hut for the evening, the group enjoys a meal around a fire with [[Tinjong]] preparing a thin broth. Huarwar admitted that they were sent by [[Avarice|Lady Avarice]] to investigate leads on [[Solstice Isle]]. The Frostmaiden's winter displeased the Lady. But they had to turn back)
