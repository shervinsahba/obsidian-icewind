summary: A Call Through Time and Space
saga: Reghed Glacier
description: On their way towards Reghed Glacier, Tetro is compelled to navigate towards a call stemming from the psi crystal humming in his shell. We feel compelled, he silently muses. On arrival, the group scours a crashed nautiloid ship. Its cargo hold housed various creatures or specimens. Signs of a struggle led the party to uncover the ship's fate. A slaad escaped and brought the vessel down before fleeing. Perhaps this encountered for the infestation at Revel's End. Tetro is driven by a telepathic connection to aid the wounded mind flayer captain, which leaves Fern and Gadget to snap him out of this fugue state. In the end, they clear the ship, and Tetro feels the beginnings of a psychic connection to the ship itself -- the Id Ascendant.

## Towards Reghed Glacier
- (x::  #TheForgottenRealm #TheSignal The party begins their journey towards the frozen waterfall at [[Reghed Glacier]] whose location they have roughly determined. Reuniting with [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]]) in Easthaven and provisioning to cross the planes, they set out on their journey. As [[Tetro]] navigates the group by the stars, he begins to feel a presence drawing him. The psi crystal in his pouch is stirring with energy. The presence it seems, it not too far off of their path. Tetro is compelled to gently nudge their course in that direction out of curiosity.) 

## Id Ascendant
- (x:: #TheSignal #battle The signal is coming from a crashed nautiloid. Investigating the wreck, the party makes their way around the downed hull of the ship, battling several carrion crawlers that seem to have escaped from the ship's damaged underbelly. Why is the ship holding these creatures? [[Tetro]] wonders...)
- (x:: #TheSignal #battle Working their way through a hole on the battle deck, they entered the cargo hold. Various creatures were being held in orbs of pink viscuous fluid -- likely some product of brain matter the Illithid used for sustenance. The creatures included carrion crawlers and other Underdark denizens as well as several slaadi. The presence of several shattered orbs and missing creatures accounted for those outside. Some investigation by [[Gadget]]revealed that a slaad specimen had broken free and wreaked havoc before fleeing, causing the ship to crash. Perhaps this was the slaad they fought at [[Revel's End]], thought [[Fern]]. As the party rummaged through the wreckage, a large orb containing a flesh golem shattered leading to battle.)
- (x:: #TheSignal A voice in [[Tetro]]'s head was dismayed by condition of these specimens. They were important to their collection. *Our collection.* Alarming [[Fern]] and [[Gadget]], Tetro began searching for the life support systems. Then paused. He headed upstairs. The party soon found him lifting up a wounded mind flayer, the ship's owner. Stopping and blinking, Tetro affirmed he needed to help *us*, dragging the mind flayer towards the life support chambers.)
- (x:: #TheSignal The party wasn't about to let [[Tetro]] do, well, whatever he was doing for this Illithid. They intervened, leading to a battle. Tetro eventually snapped out of his trance and was able to push back against the telepathic influence. In the end the party was left in the empty ship, one that Tetro felt somewhat connected with... Perhaps with time, he could pilot it? Time will tell.Before they pushed onwards, [[Gadget]] made sure to loot a radiant pistol from the command room.)
