## Auril and her Roc.
![[npc_auril_and_iskra.png]]
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden Opting to shelter for the night in the [[Black Cabin]], the party feasted moose meat and drank [[Macreadus]]'s wine. The surrounding mile had turned green and warm form the [[Summer Star]], though a chill still blew in on the wind and snowflakes intermittently fell. Nearing midnight, [[Azgul]] perceived voices on the wind, like the sound of frost. [[Tetro]] saw no aurora in the sky and took note of a bird of prey passing the moon.)
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden The bird was no storm eagle. It was a legendary [[Roc]], and it landed on the roof of the [[Black Cabin]] and began preening its wingspan of at least a hundred feet with its raptor beak. Soon a voice prompted the party to exit, and after an attempt to stealth away, they soon met with [[Auril|Auril the Frostmaiden]]. She appeared as a 7 foot tall humanoid with the head of a snowy owl, black talons, cloven hooves, and great curved goat horns protruding from her head. Her cloak and cowl appeared as part wolf fur and part pristine snow. The party later heard legends that this appearance has led to her being called the *Cold Crone*.)
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden [[Auril]] demanded to see the Summer Star, whose magic she detected when its radiant burst fired. When the party resisted, she froze [[Crank]] and [[Oona]] and used the time to hone her detection of the magical item. She found it, teleporting besides [[Tetro]] and clutching the "useless trinket." Her frost began taking it over, the magical creaking and craftsmanship coming undone. With quick thinking the party set up a diversion, [[Fern]] using [[Jarnathan]] as bait, [[Azgul]] creating mirror images of himself about the Frostmaiden, and [[Tetro]] casting *heat metal* on the [[Summer Star]] before wild-shaping into a velociraptor and dashing into the woods. The party fled [[Auril]], who looked through the remaining [[Azgul]] before teleporting onto the back of her [[Roc]] and flying away.)
- (x:: #battle After fleeing [[Auril]] at the [[Black Cabin]], the party fought against a full strength Coldlight Walker and an initially camouflaged Ice Mephit.)
- (x:: #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden #LakeMonster Re-cooperating in [[Lonelywood]] from the events at the [[Black Cabin]], the party took stock that they lost their sled dogs and that the [[Summer Star]] was damaged, though perhaps not irredeemably. They decided to quest to [[Bremen]] to take care of the supposed lake monster in [[Maer Dualdon]] for now.)
- (x:: #LakeMonster At the docks in [[Bremen]], the party met [[Grynsk Berylbore]] who mistook them for fishers he drunkenly hired the night before. After a heated exchange with the lout, a half-elf named [[Tali]] interjected that Berylbore was dooming the fishermen due to the lake monster. The party shocked them when they admitted they were *seeking* the beast. They convinced Tali, who is a researcher of the local fauna, to join them and for Berylbore to give up his two rowboat for the journey.)
- (x:: #LakeMonster After some hours navigating the ice floes on [[Maer Dualdon]] and fishing - [[Tetro]] caught a spotted eel and [[Hazel]] caught a 40 lb knucklehead! - the party encountered a plesiosaurus, the lake monster. [[Azgul]] had readied a blast, so he fired.)
- (x:: #battle #LakeMonster The party fought the plesiosaurus from their rowboats as well as from nearby ice floes after [[Crank]] netted it. They were surprised when the beast spoke! It had been awakened by [[Ravisin]] to terrorize Ten Towns and convinced by her that if it failed to kill in reverence of the [[Auril|the Frostmaiden]], then she would revoke its new-found intelligence. The party, with mixed-feelings, decided it was best to neutralize the murderous beast.)
