## Shopping in Easthaven
- (x:: The party started in Easthaven, doing some shopping. Tetro had picked up a scribe's tattoo from a pair of Reghed tribesmen he had ran into who thought him a spirit animal. At [[Peona's Potions]], [[Oona]] and [[Fern]] each purchased two potions of healing, and [[Tetro]] bought a periapt of wound closure tucked away on a shelf.)
## Caer Dineval
- (x:: The 8 hour trek, on foot, from [[Easthaven]] to [[Caer Dineval]] was uneventful and bleak. Few travelers were met on the road. Perhaps the winter is worsening. Perhaps the Caers are more remote than they thought. Perhaps both. Arriving in late afternoon, the party noted that [[Caer Dineval#Dinev's Rest|Dinev's Rest]], the local inn, was abandoned and in disrepair. Looming at the top of the hill and overlooking [[Lac Dinneshere]] was [[Caer Dineval#The Caer|the Caer]] itself. A local look quizzically at the group and suggested they stop by the one tavern, [[Caer Dineval#The Uphill Climb]].)
- (x:: At [[Caer Dineval#The Uphill Climb]], the tavernkeeper [[Roark]] reluctantly served the guests. The large tavern, a prominent structure in and of itself, was nearly devoid of patrons - just a dour old man and a quiet couple with a young child. When asking about lodging, Roark said he couldn't have room to spare. When asking about vitals, the innkeeper brought chowder but no ale; shipments of such goods had all but died down this last month.)
- (x:: #TheUnseen The party was interested in the [[Duergar]] threat, to which [[Roark]] admitted he hadn't heard of but that the northernmost town of [[Caer Konig]] had problems with unseen thieves.)
