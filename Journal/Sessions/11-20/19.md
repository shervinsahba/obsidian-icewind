## Shopping in Easthaven
- (x:: The party started in Easthaven, doing some shopping. Tetro had picked up a scribe's tattoo from a pair of Reghed tribesmen he had ran into who thought him a spirit animal. At [[Peona's Potions]], [[Oona]] and [[Fern]] each purchased two potions of healing, and [[Tetro]] bought a periapt of wound closure tucked away on a shelf.)
## Caer Dineval
- (x:: The 8 hour trek, on foot, from [[Easthaven]] to [[Caer Dineval]] was uneventful and bleak. Few travelers were met on the road. Perhaps the winter is worsening. Perhaps the Caers are more remote than they thought. Perhaps both. Arriving in late afternoon, the party noted that [[Caer Dineval#Dinev's Rest|Dinev's Rest]], the local inn, was abandoned and in disrepair. Looming at the top of the hill and overlooking [[Lac Dinneshere]] was [[Caer Dineval#The Caer|the Caer]] itself. A local look quizzically at the group and suggested they stop by the one tavern, [[Caer Dineval#The Uphill Climb|The Uphill Climb]].)
- (x:: #BlackSwords At [[Caer Dineval#The Uphill Climb|The Uphill Climb]], the tavernkeeper [[Roark]] reluctantly served the guests. The large tavern, a prominent structure in and of itself, was nearly devoid of patrons - just a dour old man and a quiet couple with a young child. When asking about lodging, Roark said he couldn't have room to spare. When asking about vitals, the innkeeper brought chowder but no ale; shipments of such goods had all but died this last month. The town's speaker, [[Crannoc Siever]], had fallen "ill" and kept to himself in the Caer. Roark didn't want to talk about it. The quiet couple eventually slipped over a note before leaving in a hurry. The note stated that the speaker was not ill and that something odd was afoot in the Caer.)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot The party was also interested in the [[Duergar]] threat, to which [[Roark]] admitted he hadn't heard of but that the northernmost town of [[Caer Konig]] had problems with unseen thieves. He expressed doubt that the thieves would get caught, because the villagers were spread too thin to form a proper militia and because Konig's Speaker, "war hero" [[Trovus]], was a drunken mess.)
## The Black Swords
- (x:: #BlackSwords #ADuergarPlot [[Thoob]] grimly greeted the party through a slit at the barricaded wooden gates of [[Caer Dineval#The Caer|Caer Dineval]]. The speaker was ill he said. A bit of lackluster deception with [[Hazel]] posing as a doctor didn't move the black-hooded guard. What perked his interest was talk of the [[Duergar]]. "This would appease the master. I will come back to you." The party was left unattended for a while, during which [[Tetro]] boosted [[Crank]] up the eastern ramparts. Thoob did return and led the party though the barbican's gatehouse, past the raised courtyard, and into the great hall of Caer. Passing a tiefling servant girl, who Thoob called [[Mere]] and hassled to clean up before supper, the party was led to a sumptuous sitting room to meet [[Kadroth]].)
- (x:: #BlackSwords #ADuergarPlot [[Kadroth]] was a middle-aged tiefling man in well-kept garb. He assuaged the party that he was the right hand of Speaker [[Crannoc Siever]], that the poor speaker has kept to his bedchambers due to a malaise of the mind. Insight proved that he was indeed acting as the right hand, to an extent, but that his "care" for the speaker was a equivocal at best. Nevertheless the party heard him out, as his men had indeed tracked the Duergar menace and located an outpost. Kadroth, clutching his black sword chardalyn pendant and extolling the virtue of stopping the duergar threat, was happy to arrange an alliance to help with the Duergar. When pressed about the "faith" of these apparent cultists, Kadroth praised the Archdevil [[Levistus]], Lord of Stygia, the 5th level of the Nine Hells. [[Levistus]] spoke to him, he claimed. Levistus, patron of the desperate and forgotten, had brought salvation to most members in his fold. Kadroth was merely his envoy. The cult was named after their lord: the cult of the [[Black Swords]].)
- (x:: #BlackSwords [[Crank]], meanwhile, had snooped through a guard tower. Overhearing some dialogue, he heard that the Black Swords cultists had performed burial rites for [[Faith]]. One cultist wondered if she was related to that albino witch [[Avarice]], to which another replied that Faith was much sweeter than the frightful wizard. As a guard came upstairs, Crank surprised him. A bit of smooth talking had the cultist lead [[Crank]] to the main hall, where others had since gathered as a meal was soon to be served by the caer's incumbent chef, [[Karou Chorizo]].)
- (x:: #BlackSwords [[Kadroth]] had gleefully urged the party to speak with their soothsayer, the old and heartless[[Hethyl Arkorran]]. Hethyl knew each party member by name. She had dreaded this day, as she know it would be her last. She was to die, and her soul was bound for the Nine Hells. She did so only after prophesying carnage at Ten Towns at the hands of the Duergar and the party's role in mitigating it. "Try, try, try... amidst countless screams." With a deep-set hatred for Duergar, she envisioned [[Sunblight Fortress]] nestled in the mountains. One entrance by ground, yet exhausts open to the air as well. The fortress hosted a forge powered by a red dragon's still-beating heart, and a great weapon was being forged from the black ice for [[Xardorok Sunblight]]'s paranoid campaign to raze and conquer Icewind Dale. Hethyl near-blind eyes grew dim after the conversation. Her heart stopped, and she fell dead.)
- (x:: #BlackSwords [[Thoob]] was elated that [[Hethyl Arkorran|Hethyl]] died. Master [[Kadroth]] was jealous of her status in the cult, and Thoob hastily left to tell the master the good news. The party took a chance to deliberate. They needed to find the true Speaker, and they debated how far they could trust the hospitality of the [[Black Swords]]. Asking the servant girl [[Mere]], she led them to the speaker's room, and immediately they were all told off by a Black Swords guard. With dinner calling, they needed to hatch a plan.) 
- (x:: As [[Oona]] and [[Crank]] entertained the excitable dullard [[Thoob]] over one of Chef [[Karou Chorizo]]'s 50 trout recipes, [[Fern]] and [[Azgul]] would make use of spare robes and disguises. [[Fern]] would pose as [[Mere]] and bring the speaker his dinner. [[Hazel]] preoccupied [[Mere]] in the kitchen. )
