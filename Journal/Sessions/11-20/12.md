## Exploring Bremen
- (x:: #LakeMonster Having hauled the carcass of [[Maer Dualdon]]'s awakened plesiosaur back to the [[Bremen]] docks, the party carved out a ***plesiosaur hide*** and ***12 rations*** of meat. [[Tali]] was given the head of the beast to study and offered to introduce the party to a friend of hers who studies local fauna.)
- (x:: #NatureSpirits [[Tali]] introduced the party to [[Dannika Graysteel]], another half-elf scholar who has been staying in [[Bremen]] for months searching for hints of [[Fauna|Chwinga]] activity. Dannika's nose is more in her books than her legs are in the field, though. She gives the party a ***lantern of tracking*** that supposedly glows greenish-blue in the presence of the nature spirits.)
- (x:: #WhaleHunters #DarkDuchess The party banters with a group of thuggish seamen at the [[Bremen#Black-Bearded Brother|Black-Bearded Brother]], the lot of whom are already soused before midday. They're conspiring to head north to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] to capitalize on the whaling colonies' incompetence over hunting a particularly large whale. They also talked about the wreckage of the [[Dark Duchess]], a Luskan merchant vessel. )
- (x:: #TheSignal Amidst talking about the [[Spine of the World]], a ping rang out in [[Tetro]]'s head. "Find us!" it said.)
- (x:: #BlackSwords Wrapping up their lodging at the local inn, [[Bremen#Buried Treasures|Buried Treasures]], they took note of the distraught and nervous innkeeper, [[Cora Mulphoon]]. Cora beseeches the adventurers to bring news of her missing son, [[Huarwar Mulphoon]]. Huarwar went missing during a blizzard while searching for the town's doddering elderly speaker, [[Dorbulgruf Shalescar|Dorbulgruf]]. Huarwar returned days later, but was cold and distant. Cora found what looked like a shard of [[Chardalyn| black ice]] in his room. Huarwar snatched it back and threatened her to never touch it again. The next day two tieflings with black amulets came to town and offered Huarwar sanctuary at their castle. He left with them two months ago.)


## A Return to Targos

![[rotf_87_naerth_and_skath.png]]

- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller The party headed to [[Targos]] to investigate the string of murders that they were initially hired for by retired bounty hunter [[Hlin Trollbane]]. At the [[Targos#Luskan Arms|Luskan Arms]], the depressed innkeeper [[Owenn Tarsenal]] discussed the lottery with them and, after remembering that this party were the ones who delivered the stolen armory goods, that Speaker [[Naerth Maxildannar|Naerth]] may be worth speaking with.)
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller At the local tavern, [[Targos]]'s [[Targos#Three Flags Sailing|Three Flags Sailing]], the warm tavernkeeper [[Ethen Ma Tarbroul]] noted that the lotteries conducted by [[Naerth Maxildannar|Naerth]] and [[Skath]] must be for the greater good of fending off winter's wrath. They tie up the lottery winners outside the walls for the cold to spirit away during the night. The last lottery winner ran away, though, and was found hewn nearly in half in the snowfields. This most recent winner also ran, but was caught by mercenaries working for [[Torg]]'s merchant company.)
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller The party met [[Naerth Maxildannar]] in his lodging on the second floor of the [[Targos#Luskan Arms|Luskan Arms]]. Captain [[Skath]] stood guard and was about to turn the party away, but Naerth, who was feeding his pet flying snakes, heard [[Crank]] outside and let them in. Naerth was so pleased to see "his boy" Crank, though, perhaps, the feeling wasn't mutual. Naerth extolled the virtues of the current lottery, the strength and importance of [[Targos]], and the dire straits that he believes [[Dalefolk|Ten Towns]] is in with the current winter. He so warmly offered his services to the party. He and Skath were off to meet [[Torg]] over the lottery escapee, and the party decided to accompany them.)
- (x::  #TheMeadMustFlow [[Naerth Maxildannar|Naerth]] noted such immense grief over the loss of [[Good Mead]]'s speaker. He said he was diligently working on providing a new speaker for the town.)
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller Following [[Naerth Maxildannar|Naerth]] to [[Torg]]'s [[Targos]] warehouse, the adventurers saw the teenage girl fugitive. While Torg was negotiating with Naerth, a mercenary in his hire, [[Sephek Kaltro]], demanded that the girl meet her immediate end for her crimes. This escalated quickly, culminating in Sephek's execution of the girl and Naerth's digust with Torg's enterprise. Torg, in a rage and panic, told his crew to clean up this mess.)
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller In [[Torg]]'s [[Targos]] warehouse, the adventurers were able to discern that [[Sephek Kaltro|Sephek]] was a recent hire of Torg's. He was a former sailor from [[Luskan]] who served on the [[Dark Duchess]]. Sephek seemed to be a [[Midwinter Child]] from his lack of warm attire. He had ice blue eyes. [[Tetro]] and [[Hazel]] offered [[Torg]] assistance in removing and burying the nameless body and left the scene.) 
- (x:: #battle #ColdHeartedKiller [[Torg]]'s warehouse thinned out later in the evening. When asked about his time on the ship,  [[Sephek Kaltro|Sephek]] attested that those days were in his past life. When asked about the girl, Sephek praised the winter goddess, and spoke of his valiance in honoring her quarry. Battle ensued, and Sephek's true nature was exposed, as he dueled with sword and dagger of ice. He tested the strengths of [[Crank]], [[Oona]], [[Azgul]], and [[Fern]], but was hopelessly outmatched when [[Hazel]] and [[Tetro]] arrived as reinforcements. Moments before his total demise, Sephek called for [[Auril]] to witness him. Sephek slit his throat and his curdling scream began to intertwine into of a woman. In the cold [[Targos]] night, [[Azgul]] picked up Sephek's now inert longsword, noting its etched runes: Isolation, Cruelty, Endurance, and Preservation.)
