> **`=this.summary`**

## Date night with Duhg
- (x:: #battle  #TheMeadMustFlow [[Fern]] had the charmed [[Duhg]] lead her to the interior of the cave, where he had kept [[Good Mead]]'s casks. Unfortunately, an ogre, affectionately nicknamed Friend by Duhg because the lunk never remember his own name, was asleep back there and soon became roused. This led to battle and a beast war between wild-shaped great ape [[Tetro]] and the cave bear Yogobor that Duhg kept as a pet. [[Hazel]] developed a signature attack, boosting off of [[Crank]]'s mitts to crack the ogre dead. He dubbed it the Hazel Nutcracker.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow The party recovered two full casks of [[Good Mead]]'s honey mead alongside an assortment of loot from Duhg's belongings. They continued to explore the cave, though they had learned that [[Duhg]] had a date with a female verbeeg named Gahg later in the evening.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow The cave system hosted a burial chamber for an ancient indigenous tribal chieftain of Icewind Dale's past. Pictograms depicted the clan's journey across the [[Spine of the World]], a clash with giants, and the powers of a lightning infused weapon. Opening the sarcophagus, the party found a *Pearl of Power* and *Javelin of Lightning* in the hands of the female chieftain's skeleton. Taking the items cursed [[Azgul]], imposing a severe lethargy, though returning them to the skeleton recovered the condition. Eventually, [[Tetro]] and [[Crank]] picked up the two items respectively and sluggishly followed the party as they explored the final chamber of the cave.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow The last chamber featured a frozen pool. Under two feet of ice was a crystalline clear spring of water, and at the bottom was a stone statue of Silvanus, god of nature. After [[Fern]] detected abjuration magic, [[Azgul]] blasted through the ice, and [[Tetro]] shaped the waters so they could investigate, it was revealed that the pool's waters were blessed by Silvanus, providing the benefit of *Greater Restoration*. This relieved the cursed party members. [[Fern]] filled a waterskin, hoping the water would retain its properties away from the spring.)
- (x:: #battle #TheMeadMustFlow At dusk the party left the caves with a rickety wagon loaded up with good mead casks. Soon, they ran into [[Duhg]]'s woman, the verbeeg Gahg. While they avoided her at first, she returned with a vengeance, nearly killing [[Hazel]] before falling in battle to [[Azgul]]'s witchbolt and [[Oona]]'s axe. Gahg carried a basket of strange metal shards, seemingly scavenged as gift for her lover. The party members deduced this metal was completely foreign in nature and perhaps valuable.)
- (x:: #TheMeadMustFlow Back in [[Good Mead]] with the casks in hand, the party received praise, lodging, and, of course, fresh drink from [[Olivessa Untapoor]]. The next morning the company awoke at noon to an argument between townsfolk about the election for speaker. News travels fast in small towns. With the returned casks, support had magnified to promoting the reluctant cask maker Olivessa. Gossips also noted that her opponent, the popular yet surly [[Shandar Froth]], had left on urgent business immediately before dawn. Where did he go, and who is to become speaker?)
