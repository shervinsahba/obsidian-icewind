## Kuldahar
- (x:: #Kulduhar [[Iselore]] had been unable to remove the Rime-Kissed Curse from the *Heartstone Gem*. The curse appeared to be bound to a physical item or phylactery, which was slowly leeching the artifact's energy for purposes unknown. Iselore suspected that [[Eirys]] took advantage of the wellsprings of magical potency underneath the Great Oak to deploy this curse. She believed a Yuan-Ti ruin, where in decades past a portal had formed leading to a siege in Kuldahar, was where the heroes would find answers.)
- (x:: #battle #Kulduhar Back in the cold of the [[Spine of the World]], the visibility was terrible as the party crested a precipitous cliff side where the Yuan Ti ruins were located. Here they fought a growling yeti who sniffed them in the snowblind mists and cut through an array of vine blights, which they determined were caused by glowing blue crystalline growths embedded in the roots of the Great Oak.)
- (x:: #battle #Kulduhar [[Tetro]] found a steep slide of a passageway into the depths of the caverns, while [[Fern]] investigated an illusory wall hiding a descending staircase. The shelled tortle hurtled down the slide with a push from [[Crank]]. Fern focused through [[Jarnathan the familiar|Jarnathan the rat]] to head down the stairs. [[Oona]] and [[Gadget]] were the first to respond as the vine blights re-emerged, both in the current room and in the depths below where Tetro stood surrounded. It turned out that the blue crystals were a blight on the roots of the Great Oak, generating the monsters.)
