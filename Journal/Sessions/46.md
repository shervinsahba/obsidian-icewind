summary: To the Frostmaiden's Isle
saga: Solstice
description: They voyaged aboard Angajuk to Solstice Isle, the domain of the Frostmaiden. After receiving an omen from Umberlee, the party began their expedition. On the isle they met the imposter mephit Sopo, forsook the ghost of Nass Lantomir for their companion Vellynne, recovered the bauble that is Professor Skant, exchanged Crank's last breath for a means to tame his lycanthropy, and pillaged a shipwreck. Auril and her trials awaited in Grimskalle, the fortress state of a once powerful frost giant jarl. As Sopo noted, a hulking presence had begun stalking them soon after the ice gardens. Now it loomed on the bluffs overhead.

## Solstice Island
- (x::  Resting at [[Angajuk's Bell]] prior to boarding the [[Angajuk|awakened whale]] herself, the party overheard two fishers having a heated conversation. It seems a Reghed girl was stuck with a permanent scowl after "giving her pretty smile" to a hag in return for curing her ailing arm. The hag reportedly dove into the sea, grumbling about its lost coven. The party considered that [[Crank]]'s lycanthropy may be managed with such a deal if they were careful about it.)
- (x::  #Solstice The voyage to [[Solstice Isle]] aboard [[Angajuk]] would take a couple days, admitted the whale. The island seemed to wander with its own will. The journey was dark, long, and claustrophobic. Besides some bad vibes, the party made through it with decent spirits. The one notable event involved cruising through dead and forgotten ruins of [[Ostoria]], titanic beyond measure. There was a brief discussion of Ostorian lore as well as the murky ends of its civilization. In myth it was said the end coincided with the endless sleep of the demigod [[Ulutiu]], whose slumber led to the creation of the frozen north.)
- (x::  #Solstice Arriving at [[Solstice Isle]] after two nights, the party attempted to scale the posts of a dilapidated frost giant ship dock. While managing their ascent, the waves churned and a voice ebbed across the waters. They deduced it was the presence of [[Umberlee]]. She asked whether they opposed the [[Auril|Frostmaiden]], and when they correctly answered yes, they were told stepping foot on the island would enter them into the cold one's domain. Auril would immediately sense their presence. Umberlee's waves carried them higher to ease their access, before cruelly dousing them with frigid waters, prompting the first of many environmental hazards.)
- (x::  #Solstice #TheDevilYouKnow The "ice mephet" and "definitely not an imp with a hat and fake nose" [[Sopo]] awaited the travelers atop giant steps hewn of ice. He provided a map to the region, discussing such wonders as the yeti caves and ice gardens, as well as [[Auril]]'s current lair within [[Grimskalle]], the remnants of a city state fortress of an ancient frost giant queen [[Vassavicken]].)
- (x::  #Solstice [[Auril]]'s garden was a testament to the beauty of cold. It was filled with perfect ice sculptures ranging from crag cats to dragons. There were more than a few humanoids as well, and on close investigation, it seemed that some were more opaque than others. [[Tetro]] produced a flame to melt through to what he believed was a petrified adventurer. This immediately manifested a spectral avatar of the Cold Crone. DEFILER. In an instant she was gone and Tetro was embedded in a crystal of ice. Working to free him as the cold lashed into his spirit, Tetro recovered and noted that his flame melted a coin sized patch on the statue. What they saw underneath was real fur of a long forgotten adventurer's tunic. [[Sopo]] seemed amused by the whole ordeal.)
- (x::  #ArcaneBrotherhood A chittering weasel familiar caught their eye. It was near an outstretched frostbitten hand -- that of a corpse. [[Vellynne Harpell]] recognized the familiar and the professor orb that the hand was clutching. This was the corpse of [[Nass Lantomir]]. Nass's ghost revealed itself, claiming that Vellynne was only using them and compelled the party to side with her and turn against the old bitch to secure the Codicil of White. They left the ghost bound to the body, screaming into the void.)
- (x:: #Solstice Two pinpricks of light bloomed in the professor orb as [[Professor Skant]] came to life. The orb summoned a mage hand to carry himself, pompously and proudly announcing his repertoire of knowledge: vampires, the [[Netherese]], Elvish wine, and the [[Tarrasaque]]. He noticed and called out to [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]], who appeared almost embarrassed, swiftly snatching Skant from the air and pocketing him. He would be useful within [[Ythryn]] as a translator.)
- (x:: #TheChosen [[Sopo]] noted that a [[The Endurance|hulking yeti of a man]] has been following them. His eyes could see into the dense cloud of fog. The party could wait for his arrival or press on. They decided to move.)
- (x::  #Solstice Observing a second ice garden, [[Gadget]] and a couple members suddenly froze in fear. A grimacing sea hag was eyeing them from behind a statue. Overcoming their repulsion, they recognized the fey as [[Anise Chiselbone]] from the cauldron caves. [[Crank]] shooed her away, but the party prodded him to seek a deal to cure his lycanthropy. After a stoic minute, Crank did barter a deal. But it was to control his curse -- at the cost of "his last breath" and "an hour of his time". The grimacing hag scurried away to brew a potion. She said to meet outside [[Grimskalle]].)
- (x::  #battle #Solstice Descending the glacial bluffs to a shipwreck embedded in frozen seawater, the corpses of seemingly endless ghouls awakened. With their captain arising as a coldlight walker, the party fought off the horde to claim a trove of the ship's gold.)
- (x:: #TheChosen [[Sopo]] noted that their follower had arrived. Looking back at Solstice, through the thick fog, the party saw a large looming silhouette.)
