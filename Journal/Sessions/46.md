## Solstice Island
- (x::  Resting at [[Angajuk's Bell]] prior to boarding the [[Angajuk|awakened whale]] herself, the party overheard two fishers having a heated conversation. It seems a reghed girl was stuck with a permanent scowl after "giving her pretty smile" to a hag in return for curing her ailing arm. The hag reportedly dove into the sea, grumbling about its lost coven. The party considered that [[Crank]]'s lycanthropy may be managed with such a deal if they were careful about it.)
- (x::  The voyage to [[Solstice Isle]] aboard [[Angajuk]] would take a couple days, admitted the whale. The island seemed to wander with its own will. The journey was dark, long, and claustrophobic. Besides some bad vibes, the party made through it with decent spirits. The one notable event involved cruising through dead and forgotten ruins of [[Ostoria]], titanic beyond measure. There was a brief discussion of Ostorian lore as well as the murky ends of its civilization. In myth it was said the end coincided with the endless sleep of the demigod [[Ulutiu]], whose slumber led to the creation of the frozen north.)
- (x::  Arriving at [[Solstice Isle]] after two nights, the party attempting to mount the frozen cliffs at a broken frost giant dock. While managing their ascent, the waves churned and a voice ebbed across the waters. They deduced it was the presence of [[Umberlee]]. She asked whether they opposed the [[Auril|Frostmaiden]], and when they correctly answered yes, they were told stepping foot on the island would enter them in her domain. Auril would immediately sense their presence. Umberlee's waves carried them higher to ease their access, before cruelly dousing them with frigid waters, prompting the first of many environmental hazards.)
- (x::  The "ice mephet" and "definitely not an imp with a hat and fake nose" [[Sopo]] awaited the travelers atop giant steps hewn of ice. He provided a map to the region, discussing such wonders as the yeti caves and ice gardens, as well as [[Auril]]'s current lair within [[Grimskalle]], the remnants of a city state fortress of an ancient frost giant queen [[Vassavicken]].)
- (x::  [[Auril]]'s ice garden was a testament to the beauty of cold. It was filled with perfect ice sculptures ranging crag cats to dragons. There were more than a few humanoids as well, and on close investigation, it seemed that some were more opaque than others. [[Tetro]] produced a flame to melt through to what he believed was an adventurer, manifesting a spectral avatar of the Cold Crone behind him. DEFILER. In an instant she was gone and Tetro was embedded in a crystal of ice. Working to free him as the cold lashed into his spirit, Tetro recovered and noted that his flame melted the ice off a coin sized patch on the statue. What they saw underneath was a real. [[Sopo]] seemed amused.)
- (x::  A chittering weasel familiar caught their eye. It was near an outstretched hand -- that of a corpse embedded in ice. [[Vellynne Harpell]] recognized the familiar and the orb the hand was clutching. This was the corpse of [[Nass Lantomir]], who had stolen her professor orb. Nass's ghost revealed itself, claiming that Vellynne was only using them and compelling the party to side with her to secure the Codicil of White. They left the ghost bound to the body, screaming into the void.)
- (x:: Two pinpricks of light bloomed in the professor orb as [[Professor Skant]] came to life. The orb summoned a mage hand to carry himself, pompously and proudly announcing his repertoire of knowledge: vampires, the [[Netherese]], Elvish wine, and the [[Tarrasaque]]. He noticed and called out to [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]], who appeared almost embarrassed, swiftly snatching Skant from the air and pocketing him. He would be useful within [[Ythryn]] as a translator.)
- (x:: [[Sopo]] noted that the [[The Endurance|hulking yeti man]] is following them and closing in. His eyes could see into the dense cloud of fog. The party could wait for his arrival or press on. They decided to move.)
- (x::  Observing a second ice garden, [[Gadget]] and a couple members suddenly froze in fear. A grimacing sea hag was eyeing them from behind a frozen statue. Overcoming their repulsion, they recognized the fey as [[Anise Chiselbone]] from the cauldron caves and [[Crank]] shooed her away. The party turned to him, prodding Crank to seek a deal to cure his lycanthropy. After a stoic minute, Crank did barter a deal. But it was to control his curse -- at the cost of his last breath and for an hour of his time. The grimacing hag scurried away to brew a potion. She said to meet outside [[Grimskalle]].)
- (x::  Descending the glacial bluffs to a shipwreck embedded in frozen seawater, the corpses of seemingly endless ghouls awakened. With their captain arising as a coldlight walker, the party fought off the horde to claim a trove of the ship's gold. [[Sopo]] noted that their follower had arrived. Looking back at Solstice, through the thick fog, the party saw a large looming silhouette.)
