## Temple of the Four Gods
- (x::  #battle #FourGodsofFury It seemed that [[Crank]]'s lycanthropy was a  curse treatable by an exceptiounally learned sage or perhaps with a barter with a fey being. With the full moon five days away, the party thought it best to push onward. Crank braced for the worst as he activated the challenge in [[Malar]]'s chamber. Three werewolves spawned in the water... and began to drown. It dawned on [[Gadget]] that this room very never meant to be submerged. Still, the party had to fight against the pack of wolves, avoiding their teeth and the curse it carried.)
