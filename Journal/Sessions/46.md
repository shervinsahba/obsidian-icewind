## Solstice Island
- (x::  Resting at [[Angajuk's Bell]] prior to boarding the [[Angajuk|awakened whale]] herself, the party overheard two fishers having a heated conversation. It seems a reghed girl was stuck with a permanent scowl after "giving her pretty smile" to a hag in return for curing her ailing arm. The hag reportedly dove into the sea, grumbling about its lost coven. The party considered that [[Crank]]'s lycanthropy may be managed with such a deal if they were careful about it.)
- (x::  The voyage to [[Solstice Isle]] aboard [[Angajuk]] would take a couple days, admitted the whale. The island seemed to wander with its own will. The journey was dark, long, and claustrophobic. Besides some bad vibes, the party made through it with decent spirits. The one notable event involved cruising through dead and forgotten ruins of [[Ostoria]], titanic beyond measure.)
- (x::  Giant dock and Umberlee)
- (x::  Meeting Sopo)
- (x::  Ice garden)
- (x::  Followed. Hag deal)
- (x::  Nass Lantomir and Professor Skant)
- (x::  Shipwreck battle)
