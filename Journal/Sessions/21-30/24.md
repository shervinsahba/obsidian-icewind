## Revel's End
- (x:: #RevelsEnd #Prisoner237 While mulling over options, [[Fern]] revealed that she had business at [[Revel's End]]. She had been hired by a clan from the [[Dwarven Valley]] to open a magically sealed vault. The only known key rested with a dangerous associate of the dwarves, [[Prisoner 13 - Korra Glintstone|Prisoner 13]], whose true name was known to a few as Korra Glintstone. The party agreed to delay adventuring on [[Angajuk]] to head to the famed prison, given that another prisoner, [[Vaelish Gant]], could be of use to them. Vaelish, they recalled, was a disgraced [[Arcane Brotherhood]] member. [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] wished to pry information out of him about a possible entrance to the Netherese city of [[Ythryn]] but had been rejected a meeting given her wizarding affiliation.)
- (x:: #battle A frigid battle was fought against three frost druids and an awakened tree. [[Fern]] was knocked out after repeated ice storms but was quickly healed by [[Tetro]]. As [[Crank]] chased a fleeing frost druid and a pack of conjured wolves held [[Oona]], [[Azgul]], and [[Gadget]] at bay, [[Fern]] returned to deal the killing blow. The party was victorious.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd The imposing prison loomed above icy cliffs that plunged into the darkness of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. The party saw guards posted at each tower and decided it best to announce their presence clearly. Still, they thought to don some disguises, with [[Fern]] and [[Azgul]] acting as emissaries of [[Vellynne Harpell]] and the remaining party tending to the dogs as if they were porters. The guards thought the unexpected visitors to be intriguing. After conferring with [[Marta Marthannis| Warden Marta Marthannis]], they brought them inside for shelter, stabling the dogs. The party surrendered their armaments, after which they were led down a corridor lit by many continual flame spells. The guards gave them lodging and told them to wait inside the mess hall. The warden would like a word with them.)
