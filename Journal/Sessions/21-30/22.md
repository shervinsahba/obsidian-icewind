## The Dark Duchess
- (x:: #DarkDuchess Arriving at the [[Dark Duchess]], the party couldn't help but feel like they were being followed in the last hour of their journey. Nevertheless, the presence had not appeared and the icy, rimed shipwreck loomed before them. Exploration of the main deck revealed a collapsed hole in the center and freshly battered railing along the forecastle. A large creature was heard stumbling about the hold. It was identified to be an ice troll by [[Oona]] and [[Fern]]. Meanwhile, [[Tetro]] was spending time thawing the frozen door to the captain's quarters, while [[Azgul]] used his unseen servant to pry through the rear captain's windows.)
- (x:: #DarkDuchess The captain's log hinted that the ship had sighted [[Arveiturace|Iceclaws]], the famed white wyrm of the north. “That damned white dragon is back, circling above me like a vulture. Reckon she could carry this ship back to Luskan were she of a mind to. To die from starvation, bitter cold, or a dragon? Choices, choices.” The dragon apparently attacked a few days later, mooring the ship in an ice flow. Facing doom, the first mate, [[Sephek Kaltro]], and the ship surgeon planned to head out with dogs to find help while [[Captain Bluebeard]] remained on board to guard their cargo and rum. Unfortunately, a passenger referred to as the mage [[Nass Lantomir|Nass]], stole off with the dogs before dawn broke, leaving Sephek and the unnamed surgeon on foot. In the captain's quarters they found a chest within which was some loot as well as an *Eyes of the Eagle*, which the captain had used to spot threats on the horizon. The captain himself lie dead in his chair, frozen stiff. The rum, the party later found, was largely missing from the holds or drunk.)
- (x:: #DarkDuchess In the first mate [[Sephek Kaltro]]'s cabin, they found a journal chronicling the Luskanite's travels. He wrote about his child, back in [[Luskan]]. He wrote, in worry, about the increasingly icy seas and [[Captain Bluebeard]]'s dragon sighting, thinking to increase his prayers to whichever gods may help his passage through the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. His final journal entry, dated at the beginning of the Fading, the 9th month, a month or two before the party arrived into Icewind Dale, was grim. He remarked that he and the ship surgeon would be setting out into the tundra, hoping to reach [[Ten Towns]], forced to walk into the wilds after the majority of their dogs were stolen by [[Nass Lantomir]]. He wished for the endurance to bear this trial.)
- (x:: #battle #DarkDuchess The ice troll was a fierce opponent but no match for the party, who jumped into the hold in a blitz attack. It's cold aura left a few players licking their wounds, but its vulnerability to fire was quickly exploited to bring it down.)
- (x:: #battle #DarkDuchess The hold contained several longboats and a massive treasure hold, frozen in laminated sheets of ice. While picking away at this treasure, [[Crank]] busted down the door to the galley. A gang of kobolds had barricaded themselves inside, attempting to ward off the ice troll. Alarmed, they attacked [[Crank]] on instinct. This resulted in their deaths. The party managed to glean that the kobolds were present in service, or perhaps reverence, of the "big one." That big one was the ancient dragon [[Arveiturace]].)
- (x:: #DarkDuchess The [[Dark Duchess]] had been wrecked by [[Arveiturace]], a thousand year old white dragon. The treasure inside was a part of her hoard. Upon this realization, the heroes made a concerted effort to leave as quickly as possible, taking with them furs and the items found in the captain's quarters. With the clock working against them, the party was fastening their cargo onto sleds during their final preparations for departure on the edge of the frozen sea when [[Arveiturace]] landed on the splintered prow of the ship. The heroes fled into the snow.)

## Angajuk's Bell
- (x:: #AngajuksBell Hours later, the party arrived at [[Angajuk's Bell]], a druidic hermit's enclave turned fishing outpost in the middle of nowhere along the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Here they beseeched a local, [[Tinjong]], to grant them shelter. This being the night of the full moon, Tinjong let the party know he would be putting the fire out soon, a sacrifice honoring the Frostmaiden. [[Azgul]] intimidated the fisher, who did not budge on this practice but relented that they could stay in [[Anga]]'s cabin and use whatever wood they find if they wished to defy the gods. The party decided to stay the night at Tinjong's in the end.)
- (x:: #AngajuksBell #WhaleHunters [[Tinjong]] told the party that a brusque party had arrived, determining to kill the sperm whale [[Angajuk]] who was a local legend, known in [[Ten Towns]] for having bonded with the druid [[Anga]]. The whale, along other sea animals, would come to Anga when she rang the copper bell set out on a frozen mooring. This was decades ago, when Anga was still alive. Now her stone hut lay dormant and the bell rimed over. The fishers of [[Angajuk's Bell]], once a village reared on the philosophy of balance, were challenged by the newcomers. On one hand, slaughtering the whale would be sacrilege, but on the other, the whale oil and ambergris could sustain them, especially as the cold grew ever-challenged, almost hellbent on ending life on the coast.)
- (x:: #AngajuksBell [[Anga]]'s hut lay quiet. The locals had left it alone in honor of the druidic. Or was it a monk? The party heard [[Anga and Angajuk's Bell|mixed stories]]. The hut itself was coated in frost from seawater spray. An old wool blanket lay iced and rigid on a bed, and firewood still remain in the hearth, usable but wormed over. About the hearth, [[Oona]] noted exactly three glyphs: Isolation, Preservation, and Endurance.)
- (x:: #battle #AngajuksBell #WhaleHunters The day's blizzard kept most locals inside, but a cadre of Dalefolk were outside by a large barrel, pointing at the break in the ice near [[Anga]]'s copper bell. They were the ruffian whalers that [[Tinjong]] warned the party about. They told the locals they would hunt the whale. What they didn't know was that they were planning to poison the waters to do so, using the famed bell to lure their prize. [[Hazel]] had no patience for these fools and their disrespect of the wilds. The party struck the barrel with a flame, intending to stop their actions. It exploded. The incensed thugs put up fight, but met their end on the water's edge. The locals seemed to care more about the dead bodies than the scuffle that ensued, worried that the "tundra would take them." Worried about undead, [[Oona]], [[Crank]], and [[Tetro]] not only buried the corpses, but dismembered them to be safe.)
- (x:: #AngajuksBell Stepping out on the ice, [[Angajuk's Bell]] stood glimmering in the soft snow. [[Hazel]] felt compelled by it. The bell, when struck, rang out. Keeling over but standing, [[Hazel]]'s vision tunneled. She did not feel her companion's hand brace her. She instead saw herself, not as herself but as another. A hundred years of history. A trek to the north but not her journey. Or was it her journey? Her hands but not her hands, young but weathered from the wilds. A blizzard. Exhaustion. A meeting. Frost laden druids. An island. Solace. Contemplation. Sitting in the snow, smiling at the beauty in each unique crystal. A great whale. A better friend. An unexpected community. Her hands, aged and aching. Her woolen blanket, a gift.)
