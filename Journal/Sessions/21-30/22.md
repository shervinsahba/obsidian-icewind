## The Dark Duchess
- (x:: #DarkDuchess Arriving at the [[Dark Duchess]], the party couldn't help but feel like they were being followed in the last hour of their journey. Nevertheless, the presence had not appeared and the icy, rimed shipwreck loomed before them. Exploration of the main deck revealed a collapsed hole in the center and freshly battered railing along the forecastle. A large creature was heard stumbling about the hold. It was identified to be an ice troll by [[Oona]] and [[Fern]]. Meanwhile, [[Tetro]] was spending time thawing the frozen door to the captain's quarters, while [[Azgul]] used his unseen servant to pry through the rear captain's windows.)
- (x:: #battle #DarkDuchess The ice troll was a fierce opponent but no match for the party, who jumped into the hold in a blitz attack. It's cold aura left a few players licking their wounds, but its vulnerability to fire was quickly exploited to bring it down.)
- (x:: #battle #DarkDuchess The hold contained several longboats and a massive treasure hold, frozen in laminated sheets of ice. While picking away at this treasure, [[Crank]] busted down the door to the galley. A gang of kobolds had barricaded themselves inside, attempting to ward off the ice troll. Alarmed, they attacked [[Crank]] on instinct. This resulted in their deaths. The party managed to glean that the kobolds were present in service, or perhaps reverence, of the "big one." That big one was the ancient dragon [[Arveiturace]].)
- (x:: #DarkDuchess The [[Dark Duchess]] had been wrecked by [[Arveiturace]], a thousand year old white dragon. The treasure inside was a part of her hoard. Upon this realization, the heroes made a concerted effort to leave as quickly as possible, taking with them furs and the items found in the captain's quarters. With the clock working against them, the party was fastening their cargo onto sleds during their final preparations for departure on the edge of the frozen sea when [[Arveiturace]] landed on the splintered prow of the ship. The heroes fled into the snow.)
- (x:: #AngajuksBell #WhaleHunters Hours later, the party arrived at [[Angajuk's Bell]], a druidic hermit's enclave turned fishing outpost in the middle of nowhere along the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Here they beseeched a local, [[Tinjong]], to grant them shelter. )
