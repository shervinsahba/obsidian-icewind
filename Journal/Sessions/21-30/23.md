summary: Go go Gadget artificer. From Angajuk to Revel's End.
---

> **`=this.summary`**
> The party bid a heartfelt farewell to Hazel, whose memories of her past life as Anga flooded forward stirring a renewed kinship with the whale Angajuk and her post at the Sea of Moving Ice. Fortuitously, the gnomish artificer Gadget leaped eagerly into their company. Angajuk relayed the plights of winter in and along the Sea of Moving Ice: a deadly kraken, a mysterious underwater temple, and the island Solstice, a frigid frontier of the Frostmaiden's own. Mulling over their options, the party decided to first head towards Revel's End to pursue Fern's personal mission as well as to interrogate Vaelish Gant. Journeying along the coast, a cadre of frost druids met their match against our heroes in a chilling clash. Eventually, the group arrived at the prison, slipping into disguises and announcing their presence as associates of the Arcane Brotherhood. They were granted entrance and shelter but found themselves marooned in the prison's mess hall, weapons checked and anticipation stewing, as they prepared to parley with Warden Marthannis.

## Angajuks Bell
- (x:: #AngajuksBell [[Hazel]], coming to from the deluge of memories, was split between her own memories and that of [[Anga]], a monk who ventured to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] and found harmony in some, but not all, of the frost druids' teachings. Hazel awakened and reconnected with [[Angajuk]], the great sperm whale. Ultimately, Hazel decided to stay at [[Angajuk's Bell]] to dwell on these new and old memories. [[Gadget|Gadget Gearspark]], an gnomish artificer armorer who had been following the adventures of the party, caught up with the crew moments later. She was seeking knowledge to invent armors in an effort to advance people's conditions in the cold of Icewind Dale and had heard of the party from [[Copper]]. The party gladly invited her in on their travels as they said their goodbyes to their friend [[Hazel]] for now.)
- (x:: #AngajuksBell [[Angajuk]] knew much of the stirrings in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Notably, she mentioned three things. One, Angajuk was afraid of a kraken - most probably a juvenile but still a gargantuan sea beast - that was encroaching on her territories, posing a large threat to the underwater mammalian life and their travel. If left to fully grow, the results could be calamitous. Two, she reminisced how [[Anga]] had traveled to the Frostmaiden's island, [[Solstice]], many moons ago. Approaching that island was a fell task now, given attacks by the [[Roc]] and an increasing aura of cold. Third, Angajuk mentioned that a long lost underwater temple had been recently inhabited by sahuagin. She only knew of the ruin as the [[Temple of the Four Gods]].)
- (x:: #AngajuksBell A group of [[Reghed Nomads]] had returned to the village with a slaughtered reindeer. They returned just in time to watch [[Crank]] try to feed [[Angajuk]] a human foot. Tensions flared. After some explanation from [[Oona]], the displeased Reghedsmen told the party to bury the dead with rites to the Maiden if they're worried they'll rise up... and perhaps reconsider dismembering corpses in the future. The Reghed hunters, whose main camp was apparently nearby, made it clear that the travelers should move on.)

## Revel's End
- (x:: #RevelsEnd #Prisoner237 #Prisoner13 While mulling over options, [[Fern]] revealed that she had business at [[Revel's End]]. She had been hired by a clan from the [[Dwarven Valley]] to open a magically sealed vault. The only known key rested with a dangerous associate of the dwarves, [[Prisoner 13 - Korra Glintstone|Prisoner 13]], whose true name was known to a few as Korra Glintstone. The party agreed to delay adventuring on [[Angajuk]] to head to the famed prison, given that another prisoner, [[Vaelish Gant]], could be of use to them. Vaelish, they recalled, was a disgraced [[Arcane Brotherhood]] member. [[Vellynne Harpell|Vellynne]] wished to pry information out of him about a possible entrance to the Netherese city of [[Ythryn]] but had been rejected a meeting given her wizarding affiliation.)
- (x:: #battle A frigid battle was fought against three frost druids and an awakened tree. [[Fern]] was knocked out after repeated ice storms but was quickly healed by [[Tetro]]. As [[Crank]] chased a fleeing frost druid and a pack of conjured wolves held [[Oona]], [[Azgul]], and [[Gadget]] at bay, [[Fern]] returned to deal the killing blow. The party was victorious.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd The imposing prison loomed above icy cliffs that plunged into the darkness of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. The party saw guards posted at each tower and decided it best to announce their presence clearly. Still, they thought to don some disguises, with [[Fern]] and [[Azgul]] acting as emissaries of [[Vellynne Harpell]] and the remaining party tending to the dogs as if they were porters. The guards thought the unexpected visitors to be intriguing. After conferring with [[Marta Marthannis| Warden Marta Marthannis]], they brought them inside for shelter, stabling the dogs. The party surrendered their armaments, after which they were led down a corridor lit by many continual flame spells. The guards gave them lodging and told them to wait inside the mess hall. The warden would like a word with them.)
