## The Dark Duchess
- (x:: #DarkDuchess Arriving at the [[Dark Duchess]], the party couldn't help but feel like they were being followed in the last hour of their journey. Nevertheless, the presence had not appeared and the icy, rimed shipwreck loomed before them. Exploration of the main deck revealed a collapsed hole in the center and freshly battered railings along the forecastle. A large creature was heard stumbling about the hold. It was identified to be an ice troll by [[Oona]] and [[Fern]]. Meanwhile, [[Tetro]] was spending time thawing the frozen door to the captain's quarters, and [[Azgul]] used his unseen servant to pry through the rear captain's windows, reaching his logbook.)
