summary: Phaerimm in the Deep
saga: Dale Underdark
description: "The band delves deeper into the Underdark. Disturbing an ossified phaerimm, they collect foliage from a Sussur Tree. Soon after they run into escapees from Sunblight Fortress: a scholarly fishman mage named Sloopi D Oop, a goliath named Aruk, and a myconid named Sensi. Recruiting the latter two, whose companions were still captive in the fortress, the party treks towards a duergar mining colony. Here, they are told, a duergar princess from a clan other than the Sunblights, has taken residence, awaiting Xardarok's summons of courtship."

## Underdark Expedition
- (x:: #UnderdarkExpedition  Standing before a Sussur Tree emerging from a petrified [[phaerimm]], the party decided to harvest some of its leaves to take advantage of its antimagical aura. [[Azgul]] advised caution, as the elven scriptures surrounding the site both heralded the creature and served as a warning of its calamitous power. [[Oona]], [[Crank]], and [[Fern]] each managed to walk away with a piece of its foliage, but only after reckoning with the perturbations of the entombed monster. Neither decidedly alive nor dead, whatever seals which held this phaerimm showed the slightest of cracks, spurring Crank into madness, driving him to attack [[Tetro]] until [[Gadget]] deduced that even slumbering fossils could concentrate on their magicks.) 
- (x:: #UnderdarkExpedition The party had been watched during this encounter. There were kobolds who lived in the desolation of the drow ruins. Those ran away. There was a party up ahead, however. On meeting them, an exasperated sahuagin fishman, notably articulate and adorned in robes, chastised the group for disturbing not only such a creature but such a wonderous ruin. This fishman introduced himself as the Society of Brilliance scholar [[Sloopidoop]]. He was accompanied by two travelers, a goliath with a concussion named [[Aruk Thundercaller]] and a myconid who missed its sovereign named [[Sensei]].)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot [[Sloopidoop]] and his colleague [[Pleuruta]], a myconid and another Society of Brilliance member, had been captured by the duergar while they were on a field trip in the Northdark. Sloopi was able to teleport out of [[Sunblight Fortress]], but his escape should have landed him back at the Society. Instead, he was hurtled through ice and snow beyond belief before landing outside the fortress near a duergar mining colony. While his colleague was still detained, his teleportation brought along Pleuruta's former aide, [[Sensei]], as well as [[Aruk Thundercaller]]. Both Sensi and Aruk were inspired by the party, deciding to join them back towards the fortress to rescue their companions. Sloopi wished to remain to study the [[phaerimm]] and hesitantly considered exploring passage towards the now twilit Icewind Dale.)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot The duergar mining colony, as retold my [[Sloopidoop|Sloopi]], was under Sunblight control, and yet it still received traffic from merchants and other denizens of the deep. That's how they met a deep gnome, [[Mev Flintknapper]], who aided their escape. Importantly, there appears to have been a duergar princess in town, a woman from another clan who [[Xardorok Sunblight]] appears to have summoned in order to court. The rumor is that she is of an independent allegiance to that of the Sunblight clan. Whether or not she will prove to be useful to the party will remain to be seen.)
- (x:: #battle #UnderdarkExpedition Forging their way deeper into the Underdark, the party ran into a cavern of ropers, ferocious stalagmites lookalikes with grasping tendrils. Chaos roiled as a [[Mev Flintknapper]] appeared screaming for them to watch out, as a shambling mound was on his tail. The party, after slogging through the rock skinned ropers, managed to overwhelm the shambling mound. Taking a short rest before continuing their expedition, they eventually found themselves at a precipice with a great bridge before them.)
