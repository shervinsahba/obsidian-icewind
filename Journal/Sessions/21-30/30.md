> **`=this.summary`**
> Our heroes prepared to enter the Underdark, spending several days in Ten Towns stocking up and receiving intel on Xardorok's duergar at Sunblight Fortress. While several of their illusory items had melted into black ooze, a lone diamond remained, which they entrusted to Copper in order to recharge the Summer Star. Entering the Termalaine mines, the party set out on foot in the dank, dark, but warmer chill of the Underdark's labyrinthine caverns, which occasionally glowed with bioluminescent fungi. Stepping through an old drow ruin, the party fought off a nothic and several skeletons before arriving at a Sussur Tree, growing out of the petrified corpse of an eon old phaerimm. 

## Preparations in Ten Towns
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot  Over several days, the [[Heroes of the Cairn]] took care to prepare for the forthcoming expedition, a journey into the [[Underdark]] to infiltrate [[Sunblight Fortress]] and apprehend the duergar warlord [[Xardorok Sunblight]] before his army marches on Ten Towns with chardalyn siege weaponry. [[Gadget]] used her time to research the capabilities of the duergar military, while others convened with members of the council. [[Fern]] found a local stylist to polish and primp her horns. [[Azgul]] wandered off, then returned after picking up several potions of healing. [[Tetro]] was overheard chatting to three kobolds in a trenchcoat about fungi of the Underdark. )
