## Axebreaker Vault
- (x:: #Prisoner13 The party headed to the [[Dwarven Valley]] in order for [[Fern]] to complete the penetration of the Axebreaker Vault, the mission she had undertook to bring her to Icewind Dale in the first place. Here they ran into [[Hruna]], the Foaming Mugs miner whose sled-fulls of lost ingots they had recovered many tendays ago. She guided them in through the Dwarven enclaves to meet [[Varrin Axebreaker]], Fern's contact.)
- (x:: #Prisoner13 #TheVault [[Varrin Axebreaker]] along with two dozen eager dwarves, set out with the party to the Axebreaker vault, a masterwork of craftsmanship and a lonely, forgotten site that had remained sealed for decades. [[Fern]] presented the lockbreaker tattoo to the doorway's glyphs, which ebbed with light and bore entry into a hall filled with weapons and treasure. Varrin quickly began a search for "the cube," as he called it, while instructing [[Fern]] and company to take her promised magic item rewards.)
- (x:: #TheVault #FrostburnBlade [[Fern]] was rewarded her expected trophy, the [[Homebrew Items|Frostburn Blade]]. It was a gift for her son, she said. The Frostburn Blade was a rare longsword embued with magics of both ice and fire, but the fire was missing in this. The heart of an adult Remorhaz was needed to empower it. That being said, the party was given a chance to look over some other items as well, receiving a *Ring of Jumping* and the [[Homebrew Items|Axe of Hurricanes]].)
