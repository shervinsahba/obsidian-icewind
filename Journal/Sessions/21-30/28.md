## Axebreaker Vault
- (x:: #Prisoner13 The party headed to the [[Dwarven Valley]] in order for [[Fern]] to complete the penetration of the Axebreaker Vault, the mission she had undertook to bring her to Icewind Dale in the first place. Here they ran into [[Hruna]], the Foaming Mugs miner whose sled-fulls of lost ingots they had recovered many tendays ago. She guided them in through the Dwarven enclaves to meet [[Varrin Axebreaker]], Fern's contact.)
- (x:: #Prisoner13 #TheVault [[Varrin Axebreaker]] along with two dozen eager dwarves, set out with the party to the Axebreaker vault, a masterwork of craftsmanship and a lonely, forgotten site that had remained sealed for decades. [[Fern]] presented the lockbreaker tattoo to the doorway's glyphs, which ebbed with light and bore entry into a hall filled with weapons and treasure. Varrin quickly began a search for "the cube," as he called it, while instructing [[Fern]] and company to take her promised magic item rewards.)
- (x:: #TheVault #FrostburnBlade [[Fern]] was rewarded her expected trophy, the [[Homebrew Items|Frostburn Blade]]. It was a gift for her son, she said. The Frostburn Blade was a rare longsword embued with magics of both ice and fire, but the fire was missing in this. The heart of an adult Remorhaz was needed to empower it. That being said, the party was given a chance to look over some other items as well, receiving a *Ring of Jumping* and the [[Homebrew Items|Axe of Hurricanes]].)
- (x:: #battle #TheVault [[Varrin Axebreaker|Varrin]] found what he was looking for - a *Cubic Gate*. This was an extremely rare item, passed down from Elves to his dwarvish ancestors, holding portals up and down the Sword Coast from Amn to Ironmaster. Varrin was excited to promise a better future for the Valley's clans with these gates, allowing an influx of trade and opportunities to alleviate the ever-going winter. Eager to show it off, he opened a portal to Baldur's Gate, but a fierce and piercing cold instead ripped through the vault. Glacial blue ice spliced between the columns and metalwork. The party was halfway between planar borders, in an interstitial space between the Material Plane and the Plane of Ice. [[Gadget]] was a translucent figure yelling at the party to get back from a vault that appeared far away, but the remaining five were delayed by two looming rime hulks, primed for battle. As huge cubes of frost crashed to the ground, [[Azgul]] was pinned as the portals began to collapse. With a quick rescue by [[Oona]] and company, they made it safely back to the vault. It appeared, though, a few dwarves were missing. [[Azgul]] promptly intimidated the shaken Varrin to grant them another item for the mess they were dragged into, obtained the group a *Circlet of Blasting*.)
- (x:: #TheVault Back at a dwarven tavern, tiki themed and aptly named The Hurricane, stories of Varrin's Blunder were percolating within the crowd. One old timer shared talk about Chult with [[Tetro]] and gave him a *Cloak of Billowing*. )

## Ten Towns Speaker Meeting
- (x:: #TheCouncil Returning to [[Bryn Shander]], our heroes headed to the town hall to contribute to the discussion on the duergar menace. They ran into [[Kadroth]], the defacto leader of the [[Black Swords]], in the lobby who assuaged them that the hostilities of the freed prisoners at [[Caer Dineval]] were, well, a misunderstanding, and that perhaps they could work together to act against the duergar.)
