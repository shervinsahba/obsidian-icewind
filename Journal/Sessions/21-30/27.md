## The Lost Spire
- (x:: #TheLostSpire #DzaanIsDead [[Dzaan]]'s simulacrum urged the players to consider activating the rune chamber, despite [[Azgul]]'s apparent hesitation. It couldn't hurt to look, they said. The rune chamber hummed with arcane energy as a holographic illusion of its creator beckoned the party to set an illusion inside and touch it, to transform thought into reality. [[Gadget]] took note of the fissures in the walls on which the byzantine runes were etched. They seemed to crackle and spark, having seen better days.)
- (x:: #TheLostSpire [[Fern]] )
