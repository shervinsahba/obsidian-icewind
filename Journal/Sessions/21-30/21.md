## Looking through Nildar's Duergar Outpost 
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot After the battle, the party investigated [[Nildar Sunblight]]'s Duergar Outpost. It seemed that Nildar had been experimenting with myconid spores, infecting Dalefolk in the hopes of creating a small army. A letter to his father, [[Xardorok Sunblight]], beseeched his father to listen, dissuading the father from his chardalyn obsession. Nildar believed that his spore servants could be the path to victory, not the behemoth his father was constructing. Nildar even expressed some worry at the pervasive effects of chardalyn. That being said, the duergar was no stranger to cruel methods of war, as noted by his duergar screamer's painful, psionic mech suit. [[Oona]] and company tossed their storage area, as well as Nildar's chambers, recovering 70 sp and the missing items from [[Caer Konig]].)
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot The party returned to [[Caer Konig]] to rest up, surprising [[Allie Shorard|the Shorard sisters]] with their colorful magic lantern for the inn. They had also recovered [[Jarthra Farzassh]]'s heirloom pearl beads and two missing sheep.)
## Backtracking through Ten Towns
- (x:: #DarkDuchess The party considered their next steps, unfurling a map of possibilities near the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. They decided to begin at the west, heading towards the [[Dark Duchess]] in search of treasure. They learned that the vessel was supposed to be carrying ale, even, with a bounty set by the [[Bremen#Five-Tavern Center|Five Tavern Center in Bremen]]. Moreover, they recalled that [[Sephek Kaltro]] had rode that ship, as did the Arcane Brotherhood apprentice [[Nass Lantomir]], who stole a magic bauble from [[Vellynne Harpell]] as she was setting out from Luskan many moon ago.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn #TheForgottenRealm  Stopping in [[Bryn Shander]], the party made their way to the Temple of the Morninglord. Here they ran into [[Perilou]], the acolyte of Yolanda they rescued from [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. She had been studying in service of the priestess, [[Mishann]], who was in prayer. After a bit of persuasion about the gnomish artisan [[Copper]], Perilou relented and brought them to the grouch's lodgings in the attic. Copper was dressed in a furry bear suit, had the deepest possible voice, and was oscillating varyingly between grousing and sobbing when pressed about [[Macreadus]]. He explained that the [[Summer Star]] was a tiny model of a Netherese Mythallar, a weave conduit and engine that powered their magic cities. Macreadus had become obsessed with the idea of controlling the weather to hush the Endless Winter, despite Copper's protest. The Summer Star's core was consecrated chardalyn, but it had lost its charge with use. A shiny diamond may do the trick, though. Copper may be able to fix it, but he fears how you dare challenge the gods.)
- (x:: #BlackSwords Stopping in [[Bremen]], [[Hazel]] delivered [[Huarwar Mulphoon]]'s scrimshaw necklace to his mother, who was happy to hear he was live, devils or not.)
## Journey into the Tundra
- (x:: #battle Tremors were felt in the tundra as the party took a short rest for the sake of their sled dogs. Several [[Chwinga]] were spotted atop a nearby snowy mound. On approach, mound was discovered to be a mammoth corpse. Large claws had grappled it at some point, and sizable chunks of flesh were torn out by an even larger maw. It appeared to be the doing of a dragon. The tremors increased in intensity until the ground about the mammoth caved in. An adolescent remorhaz reared its head, grabbing at the corpse to scavenge. The party attacked, and thus the beast retaliated. Eventually it was slain, but only after it swallowed [[Oona]] and began to tunnel away. Thankfully, she cut herself out of its dead belly before its acids could burn her to bone.)
