## Looking through Nildar's Duergar Outpost 
- (x:: #ADuergarPlot After the battle, the party investigated [[Nildar Sunblight]]'s Duergar Outpost. It seemed that Nildar had been experimenting with myconid spores, infecting Dalefolk in the hopes of creating a small army. A letter to his father, [[Xardorok Sunblight]], beseeched his father to listen, dissuading the father from his chardalyn obsession. Nildar believed that his spore servants could be the path to victory, not the behemoth his father was constructing. Nildar even expressed some worry at the pervasive effects of chardalyn. That being said, the duergar was no stranger to cruel methods of war, as noted by his duergar screamer's painful, psionic mech suit.)
- (x:: The party returned to [[Caer Konig]] to rest up, surprising [[Allie Shorard|the Shorard sisters]] with their colorful magic lantern for the inn.)
## Backtracking through Ten Towns
## Journey into the Tundra
- (x:: #battle Tremors were felt in the tundra as the party took a short rest for the sake of their sled dogs. Several [[Chwinga]] were spotted atop a nearby snowy mound. On approach, mound was discovered to be a mammoth corpse. Large claws had grappled it at some point, and sizable chunks of flesh were torn out by an even larger maw. It appeared to be the doing of a dragon. The tremors increased in intensity until the ground about the mammoth caved in. An adolescent remorhaz reared its head, grabbing at the corpse to scavenge. The party attacked, and thus the beast retaliated. Eventually it was slain, but only after it swallowed [[Oona]] and began to tunnel away. Thankfully, she cut herself out of its dead belly before its acids could burn her to bone.)
