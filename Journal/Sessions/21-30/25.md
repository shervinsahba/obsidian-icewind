## Revel's End
- (x:: #RevelsEnd [[Azgul]], [[Fern]], [[Tetro]], and [[Gadget]] waited in the mess hall while [[Oona]] and [[Crank]] took a nap in the guest rooms. [[Tetro]] befriended some of the kitchen staff, while [[Gadget]] took a look at the Dwarven artificing used to heat [[Revel's End]] to a balmy temperature. One guard was muttering about stomach pains when the half-orc [[Stolga Stone|Lieutenant Stone]] arrived to bring the party to [[Marta Marthannis|Warden Marthannis]].)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd #Prisoner237 #Prisoner13 [[Azgul]] and [[Fern]] spoke with the stern and cool-headed mage, [[Marta Marthannis|Warden Marta Marthannis]]. Once it was sorted out that the party were not [[Arcane Brotherhood]] operatives, but, rather, adventurers who had found themselves at the center of all things Icewind Dale, the warden eased up a bit. [[Fern]] was able to arrange a meeting with [[Prisoner 13 - Korra Glintstone|Prisoner 13]], though the cautious warden refused an immediate audience with [[Vaelish Gant|Prisoner 237, Vaelish Gant.]] Bringing up their collaboration with Easthaven's speaker [[Danneth Waylen]] and captain [[Imdra Arlaggath]], they asserted that speaking with Vaelish would be vital for the safety of Icewind Dale. [[Azgul]] promised to relay a sending stone message and replay it for the warden.)
