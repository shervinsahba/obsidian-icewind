## Revel's End
- (x:: #battle #RevelsEnd Lights sputtered against black hallways as the siren blared in [[Revel's End]]. [[Gadget]], [[Tetro]], and [[Fern]] were caught in combat with a red slaad as prisoners and guards clashed against other threats. [[Vaelish Gant]] was seen looking for spellcasting reagents. [[Prisoner 13 - Korra Glintstone|Prisoner 13]] was attacked by a red slaad and defended herself with her river tattoo. [[Azgul]] was lost in the fray. [[Oona]] and [[Crank]] awoke to chaos and soon found themselves fighting off another red slaad near the mess hall.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd A weak-voiced [[Stolga Stone]] announced over the intercom that the warden was facing a threat on the roof of the tower. Entering the central tower, Stone was seen bleeding out near the facility control panel. [[Tetro]] healed her up, so she went with the party up the tower, passing a demolished guard barracks, before arriving on the third level's Absolution Council Room. Here, warden [[Marta Marthannis]] was sitting with her face in her hands, a hopeless, deranged smile across her face.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd The warden's responses about the slaad threat were mostly nonsense. Lieutenant Stone was concerned that Marta would activate the facility self-destruct and was doubly concerned when the warden said nothing about the Wand of Binding, which was meant to control threats like these. [[Fern]] and Stone went to search the warden's chambers for the wand, while the remaining party headed to the roof. [[Crank]] scooped up the dazed warden and took her with.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd On the roof, in the chill of heavy snowfall, a gray slaad was prowling. [[Gadget]] sent an attack right into the creature, whose image only twisted and sputtered. It was a powerful illusion, but for the moment only she could tell. [[Crank]] continued to attack, as the warden who he just sat down unhinged her jaw, a black cone of fear magic emanating from within. Enraged and frightened, [[Oona]] sprinted down the staircase, getting nicked by the warden's fingernails. The warden laughed at her own feeble human hands.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd Simultaneously, [[Fern]] and [[Stolga Stone]] were ransacking the warden's office. [[Fern]] found the Wand of Binding in a hidden compartment of the warden's desk... and soon found the warden, dead and stuffed in a closet, heart ripped out. They bolted for the roof, almost colliding with [[Oona]].)
- (x:: #battle [[Stolga Stone]] ran up the stairs and immediately attempted to shove the supposed warden off. She failed. The warden transformed, and the battle with the true grey slaad ensued on the rooftop of [[Revel's End]]. [[Tetro]] assumed constellation form to bolster the party, as [[Fern]] and [[Gadget]] laid into it with knife and fist.[[Oona]], having come to her senses, hurled the slaad off the tower. It landed 140 ft below on the lower roof. [[Crank]] jumped down after, tossing a lightning javelin and slow-falling not a moment too soon. The rest of the party continued their assault from roof top and tower windows. The slaad, though, was able to take flight, and fireballed the roof. Dodging the blast, [[Oona]] opened her eyes to see [[Stolga Stone]] incinerated and falling to her death. But the slaad couldn't last. It died midair and fell once again, the resulting splash soaking [[Crank]] in slaadi guts and goo.)
- (x:: #RevelsEnd The slaad threat had been squashed. [[Revel's End]] is now in a tense ceasefire. A good number of lives were lost for both guards and prisoners. [[Tetro]] used the sending stones to inform [[Danneth Waylen]] about the scenario, and a guard captain named [[Clay]] sought to keep the peace as our adventurers rested. )
