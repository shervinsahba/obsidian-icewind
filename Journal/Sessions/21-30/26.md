## Revel's End
- (x:: #battle #RevelsEnd Lights sputtered against black hallways as the siren blared in [[Revel's End]]. [[Gadget]], [[Tetro]], and [[Fern]] were caught in combat with a red slaad as prisoners and guards clashed against other threats. [[Vaelish Gant]] was seen looking for spellcasting reagents. [[Prisoner 13 - Korra Glintstone|Prisoner 13]] was attacked by a red slaad and defended herself with her river tattoo. [[Azgul]] was lost in the fray. [[Oona]] and [[Crank]] awoke to chaos and soon found themselves fighting off another red slaad near the mess hall.)
