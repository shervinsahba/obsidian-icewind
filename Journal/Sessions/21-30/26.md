## Revel's End
- (x:: #battle #TheLostSpire Departing from [[Revel's End]], the party set a course towards the Netherese [[Lost Spire]] that had been unearthed by [[Dzaan]] prior to his execution. Along the way, the party came across a skirmish between chardalyn berserkers and some [[Reghed Nomads]] from the Tribe of the Bear. The berserkers had lost their minds to chardalyn corruption, which tested [[Azgul]] as well, who managed to overcome but pocket the fragment he was holding on to.)
