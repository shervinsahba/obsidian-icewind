> **`=this.summary`**
> The party ascended a lost spire of Netheril, by descending into the inverted tower, which had fallen into the ice and was forgotten until uncovered by Dzaan's expedition. Within the tower they found Dzaan's simulacrum, and as words fired between mentor and his once apprentice, Azgul, the party took down a rogue ice salamander. Soon after, the sorrowsworns attacked. Now our heroes face a dilemma. How will they use the rune chamber which can turn illusion into reality? Do they aid Dzaan?

## The Lost Spire
- (x:: #battle #TheLostSpire Departing from [[Revel's End]], the party set a course towards the Netherese [[Lost Spire]] that had been unearthed by [[Dzaan]] prior to his execution. Along the way, the party encountered a skirmish between chardalyn berserkers and a pair of [[Reghed Nomads]] from the Tribe of the Bear. The berserkers had lost their minds to chardalyn corruption. [[Azgul]] began feeling his stone's perturbing presence, as well, and though he was capable of parting with the stone, he nevertheless kept it. As the parties clashed, black ice javelins exploded with shatter magic. The two Reghedsmen died in battle while the final berserker vanished in a blue flame as he adjusted a sapphire blue ring on his finger.)
- (x:: #TheLostSpire The [[Lost Spire]] was upside down, buried in the tundra with the jet black stone of its base jutting upwards. A tunnel in the snow descended to its entryway, which appeared to have broken off a larger structure. [[Fern]] used [[Jarnathan the familiar]] in rat form and noted a sealed entrance guarded by inverted, blindfolded wizard statues.[[Tetro]] slid down on his shell, and after affixing a rope, others followed. [[Azgul]] comprehended the language of Loross, noting that the statues depicted the head wizard of this particular tower, an illusionist named Lorietta. The statues hinted the solution to enter - those who didn't watch the door could freely pass.)
- (x:: #TheLostSpire Traveling within the inverted [[Lost Spire]], the party took note that many items and books had been recently removed. Picking through the remnants, they read through accounts of the magic-hungry creatures called the [[Phaerimm]], histories of Netheril before Karsus's Folly, and observations of extra-planar species in old wizarding laboratories. This tower once served as a place of learning. Standing piggyback atop [[Crank]] and then [[Oona]]'s shoulders, [[Fern]] opened a chest on the inverted floor causing resistance potions to tumble down and later touched an altar of Mystryl, manifesting a divine elixir giving her the minor illusion cantrip.)
- (x:: #TheLostSpire #DzaanIsDead #GolemGuardian On the third floor of the [[Lost Spire]], [[Tetro]] opened a door into a makeshift office. Behind the desk sat [[Dzaan]] and his wight bodyguard [[Krintaas]]. On the desk was a shield guardian's amulet, which Dzaan could not make sense of because, well, Dzaan was not Dzaan. He was a simulacrum. A copy of sorts, conjured of snow and ice. [[Azgul]] made his way into the room to interrogate the wizard, who admitted to have no idea why [[Azgul]] was in Icewind Dale, something the amnesiac warlock had been trying to piece together himself. The simulacrum only knew what his master did up until the time he left the spire, and carried out his master's will to watch over it.)
- (x:: #TheLostSpire #DzaanIsDead The simulacrum had not heard from his master in a ten day, evidently because the real Dzaan was executed in [[Easthaven]]. Alarmed by news of his master's death, [[Dzaan]] expressed a desire to replace him. See, in the fourth level of the tower was a rune chamber that could turn illusions into reality. The party was intrigued. [[Azgul]] was alarmed. He did not wish his former tutor to regain his flesh, ever since he himself had a mark of suggestion placed on his neck when he first approached Dzaan for knowledge. Flummoxed, Dzaan's simulacrum urged the party to consider the matter, lending them [[Krintaas]] as they headed into the fourth level, knowing ahead of time that the spirits down there were restless and an ice salamander had been seen crawling about.)
- (x:: #battle #TheLostSpire [[Crank]] swigged down a Potion of Cold Resistance and dropped below. There, the party fought a cornered ice salamander, an inhabitant of the [[Plane of Ice]] that had wormed its way into this realm due to the endless winter. As the battle came to a close, [[Tetro]] dispatched [[Krintaas]] who was barely hanging on. Very soon after a second battle started when remains of the forgotten tower's wizards manifested as sorrowsworn. Battered, the [[Gadget]] rescued a dying [[Fern]] while her homunculus [[Finn]] struck a killing blow to dispatch the shadow creature. Thus the party was able to step into the tower's rune chamber.)
