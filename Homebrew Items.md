## Remorhaz Javelin
![[Pasted image 20250313204412.png|500]]
> This javelin is decorated with the frill spines and teeth of a slain remorhaz. Targets hit by this magic weapon take an extra 1d4 damage. The type of bonus damage is cold if the total of the attack roll is even, or fire damage if the total is odd.

> Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

## Great Oak Crystal
> *Wondrous Item, Pendant, (Requires Attunement)*
> A green, acorn-shaped crystal from the Great Oak of Kuldahar. This crystal has 2 charges. Expending a charge allows the wearer to cast the *[scrying](https://5e.chonky.cloud/spells.html#scrying_phb)* spell (save DC 17). By holding hands with up to six other sentient creatures, the vision may be shared. The crystal regains 1 charge at Dawn.

## Pacifying Spores
> A myconid sovereign's Pacifying Spores. When the container is thrown at a target within 30 ft, the spores disperse. The target must succeed on a DC 12 CON saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Quieting Angel Brew
> A Muzgardt Clan elixir. The quieting angel is a rare fungus in the Underdark which focuses the mind. It was found to delay the onset of chardalyn corruption, though its noxious nature often poisons the guts of non-dwarves. 
>
> A dose will prevent chardalyn corruption from increasing for three hours. Drinking the elixir as a non-dwarf requires passing a DC 12 CON saving throw, or else becoming poisoned for the duration or until the poison is cured.
