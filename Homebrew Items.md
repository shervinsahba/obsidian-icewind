## Wereshark Lycanthropy
> - **Involuntary Transformation.** You undergo a draining and painful involuntary change every full moon that leaves you hungry and often confused and frightened. During the 1 minute transformation your body involuntarily shifts into your hybrid form, and your thoughts are filled with predatory bloodlust. The DM may take partial control over your actions. Your equipment does not transform with you. Depending on the items, they may be destroyed, bent out of shape, or prove extremely restricting.
> - **Cursed Soul.** Acute stress triggers a possible transformation. Reaching zero hit points or rolling a natural 1 on an Attack Roll or Saving Throw may trigger an Involuntary Transformation even without the full moon's presence. Make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to determine whether you maintain control. On a natural 20, you learn to tame your hybrid state.
> - **Natural Armor.** Your AC is replaced by natural armor equal to 13 + DEX.
> - **Damage Immunities.** The wereshark has bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from non-magical attacks that aren't silvered.
> - **Cursed Resilience.** When the wereshark is reduced to 0 hit points, it does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, it loses the ability to take actions other than to Dash. If it takes damage from a silvered weapon while at 0 hit points, it dies.
>
> In hybrid form, you gain the Bite attack with which you are proficient. You lose your class features in this form. You either make a Bite attack or attack with whatever weapon you are wielding.
> **Bite**. Melee Weapon Attack: reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy.
  
## Blessing of the Wavemother
> You now have a swim speed. If you already had a natural swim speed, it increases by 10. If you did have a natural swim speed already, your new swim speed is half your speed plus 10, rounded up to the nearest 5.

## Remorhaz Javelin
![[Pasted image 20250313204412.png|500]]
> This javelin is decorated with the frill spines and teeth of a slain remorhaz. Targets hit by this magic weapon take an extra 1d4 damage. The type of bonus damage is cold if the total of the attack roll is even, or fire damage if the total is odd.

> Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

## Great Oak Crystal
> *Wondrous Item, Pendant, (Requires Attunement)*
> A green, acorn-shaped crystal from the Great Oak of Kuldahar. This crystal has 2 charges. Expending a charge allows the wearer to cast the *[scrying](https://5e.chonky.cloud/spells.html#scrying_phb)* spell (save DC 17). By holding hands with up to six other sentient creatures, the vision may be shared. The crystal regains 1 charge at Dawn.

## Pacifying Spores
> A myconid sovereign's Pacifying Spores. When the container is thrown at a target within 30 ft, the spores disperse. The target must succeed on a DC 12 CON saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Quieting Angel Brew
> A Muzgardt Clan elixir. The quieting angel is a rare fungus in the Underdark which focuses the mind. It was found to delay the onset of chardalyn corruption, though its noxious nature often poisons the guts of non-dwarves. 
>
> A dose will prevent chardalyn corruption from increasing for three hours. Drinking the elixir as a non-dwarf requires passing a DC 12 CON saving throw, or else becoming poisoned for the duration or until the poison is cured.
