## Pacifying Spores
> A myconid sovereign's Pacifying Spores. When the container is thrown at a target within 30 ft, the spores disperse. The target must succeed on a DC 12 CON saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Quieting Angel Brew
> A Muzgardt Clan elixir. The quieting angel is a rare fungus in the Underdark which focuses the mind. It was found to delay the onset of chardalyn corruption, though its noxious nature often poisons the guts of non-dwarves. 
>
> A dose will prevent chardalyn corruption from increasing for three hours. Drinking the elixir as a non-dwarf requires passing a DC 12 CON saving throw, or else becoming poisoned for the duration or until the poison is cured.
