The Plugin/Setting List (Turning Obsidian into a Campaign Manager)
from Joshua Plunkett's tutorials on using Obsidian for DnD

Here's a list of recommended plugins and settings that will turn Obsidian from a simple note-taking tool into a Campaign Manager Beast!

First configure the tool:

**Settings > Editor >** 

- [ ]   Spell check = enable
- [x]   Readable line length = disable
- [x]   Fold heading = enable
- [x]   Fold indent = enable
- [x]   Default new pane mode = I change depending on whether I am prepping or playing

**Settings > Appearance >** 

- [x]   Base theme = make a choice, Light is best for DnD
- [x]   Themes = pick one (recommend [Alternative ITS Theme](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian- [ ]- [ ]ITS- [ ]Theme/blob/main/Guide/Alternate- [ ]Themes.md) for DnD theme. You'll need the Style Settings community plugin. Then copy the css from the Alternative ITS Theme page add it to CSS Snippets.)
- [x]   CSS Snippets = take note of this. When you want to start playing with CSS this is where you turn it on. 

**Settings > Core Plugins >**

- [x]   Outgoing Links = enable (this is automatic link detection)
- [x]   Page Preview = enable (preview pages when you mouse over a link)
- [x]   Tag Pane = enable (quick view of all tabs in a note)
- [x]   Templates = enable (template support)
- [x]   Slash Commands = enable
- [x]   Starred = enable
