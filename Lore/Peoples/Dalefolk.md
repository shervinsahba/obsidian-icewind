The region of Icewind Dale is mainly populated by fishers, craftspeople, loggers, rangers, dwarves that mined the depths for minerals and precious stones, [[Reghed Bomad]] barbarians, and merchants that tolerated the hostile climate, in the hope of trading in ivory, gems, and other forms of natural wealth. Yet others were outcasts or criminals, who made Icewind Dale their home in the hopes that their existence would be ignored if not condoned.

While most residents of the dale lived in the Ten Towns, the dwarves mined in isolated caves and caverns while the barbarian tribes roamed after their migratory prey. 

Ten Towners typically refer to themself as Dalefolk, treating Dwarven colonies as a likeminded co-inhabitant of the lands and Reghed Nomads as an outgroup. 

## Religion and Superstitions
- **Sacrifice.**The practice of sacrifice has long been practiced to honor the gods for prosperity, nourishment, and warmth. Keenly, the very thing Dalefolk wish for is the very thing they sacrifice. It is common to see household shrines with offerings of food and warmth placed outside homes. The practice verges on superstition in [[Bryn Shander]] to religious necessity by the Reghed. Sacrifice has historical occurred in [[Easthaven]], has seen occasional honoring in [[Dougan's Hole]], and has recently been reinstated in [[Targos]].
- **[[Fauna#Chwinga|Chwinga]]**. Many Dalefolk believe in small nature spirits, whose presence is seen as a boon. They are said to have arrived in Icewind Dale centuries ago alongside Chultan seafarers.
