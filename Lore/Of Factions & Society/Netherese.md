Netheril was the ancient, magocratic human empire of Faerûn, whose influence was felt across the Realms for thousands of years. 

The Netherese were the ethnic group of dark-haired, fair-skinned humans that resided in the Netheril. Many cultures and ethnic groups in Faerûn were either descendants or absorbed into the Netherese people. Although they had humble roots as mere fishermen and farmers, the Netherese were introduced to the Art of the Arcane by the elves - before man quite knew what to think of elves - and came to harness magic power in ways that would shape Toril for generations.

The Netherese lived in a strict hierarchy for hundreds of years, split into the nobles of High Netheril, living in flying enclaves miles above Toril, and the commoners of Low Netheril settled in demesnes on the coast of the Narrow Sea. Few, if any pure-blodded Netherese exist in the 15th century, over a thousand years after the fall of the great Empire of Magic.

The High Netherese language of Loross is considered a dead language.
