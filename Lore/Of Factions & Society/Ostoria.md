Ostoria -- meaning "father's seat" in Jotun -- was also called The Colossal Kingdom. It was the original kingdom of the giants. 

Ostoria existed from circa -30000 DR to -2500 DR. To put this into perspective, [[Netherese|Netheril]] was founded in -3830 DR lasting until Karsus's Folly in -339, when the hubris of the high mages caused the Weave to flicker out of existence and their empire to literally fall from the sky.

Records of Ostoria are few and sparse. It is known that Annam, all-father of the giants, eventually split the kingdom amongst seven sons. These domains and their leaders were the progenitors of the varied giants of today's Faerun.
