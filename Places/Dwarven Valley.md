# Locations 
The Dwarven Valley was a deep rift in Icewind Dale, located along the southern slopes of the mountain called [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Within the valley was a complex network of tunnels, subterranean passages and mines that composed the home of the dale's dwarves, particularly those from Clan Battlehammer.
