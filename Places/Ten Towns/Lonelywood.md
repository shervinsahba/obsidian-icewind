A dilapidated inn, once run by [[DeGrootz Ramshackle]]. DeGrootz was found dead, hanging, in his inn about a year and half ago. During the relentless winter, the roof has since collapsed.
## Lucky Liar
Local tavern, opened a decade ago by the enigmatic and well-informed [[Danae Xotal]].
## The Happy Scrimshander
An artisan supply store run by [[Iriskree Harrowhill]], retired and doughty spinster assassin.
## Nimsy Huddle's House
Speaker [[Nimsy Huddle]] is a welcoming host. Since the town has no inn, she offers her attic to travelers.
