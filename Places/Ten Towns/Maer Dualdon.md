The lake around which Eastern Ten Towns has been settled. [[Bremen]], [[Targos]], [[Lonelywood]], and [[Termalaine]] are all along the lake. It is fed by melting ice from the [[Reghed Glacier]] and [[Sea of Moving Ice]], and its waters are carried to the northern Sea of Swords by the Shaengarne River. In warmer times, boats could make it out via the Shaengarne.
