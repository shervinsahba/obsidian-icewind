Mirabar was a mining city of great wealth located on the Sword Coast. As of 1368 DR it was the richest city north of Waterdeep. In 1370 DR, the city was occupied by 1600 shield dwarves who lived underground near to their workshops, which produced metal goods for export in the region and beyond. The humans above cooperated with the dwarves to handle the mining, move the ore to market, and defend the city against magical threats. (See https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mirabar)
