![[Nine Hells.png]]

The Nine Hells of Baator is the home of the devils and the plane that embodied lawful evil. A plane of sinister wickedness and institutional cruelty, its denizens are organized into a strict caste system with a very rigid chain of command. Each of the nine Hells had its own physical laws or properties of matter, but all are inhospitable or deadly to outsiders.

1. **Avernus**: The first layer of Hell, Avernus is a wasteland destroyed by endless warfare. Currently ruled by the fallen angel Zariel, though in the past it has been ruled by the general Bel.
2. **Dis**: A burning city of iron. Its ruler is Dispater, who inhabits a great Iron Tower.
3. **Minauros**: A polluted swamp of acid and poison. Its capital, the City of Minauros, is constantly sinking into the marsh. Its ruler is Mammon the Viscount.
4. **Phlegethos**: A realm of fire and pain. It is ruled jointly by Archduke Belial and his daughter Fierna.
5. **Stygia**: A frozen sea of icebergs and glaciers. Its ruler, Prince [[Levistus]], is trapped deep within an iceberg here.
6. **Malbolge**: An treacherous rocky slope. Ruled by the Hag Countess, one of Moloch's trusted advisors prior to the Reckoning of Hell.
7. **Maladomini**: An expanse of abandoned cities under a black sky. Its ruler is the Archduke Baalzebul.
8. **Cania**: A lethal frozen wasteland ruled by Mephistopheles.
9. **Nessus**: A land of trenches and ravines of impossible depth. Its ruler is [[Asmodeus]], who resides in the deepest pit, called the Serpent's Coil.
