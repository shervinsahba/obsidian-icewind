**Nether Scrolls**
Can't tell whose Nethers, cause they're wrapped.
Originally known as the Golden Skins of the World Serpent, the Nether Scrolls were the name given to one set of fifty scrolls that dealt with fundamental magic theory. It is unlikely that these particular nether scrolls are the same.

**Elminster's Pipe Cleaner.** 
A failed discontinued magic item by Elminster that can still be found in some places. This magic pipe cleaner was produced in mass to make the habit of smoking pipes easier and more convenient. Magic cleans pipes and imbues them with temporary fey magic, bit accidentally may cause Wild Magic to burst.

**Dwarf Thrower**
GP Value: 1,800
Dragon Magazine 156
When wielded by anyone but a dwarf, this hammer acts as a normal war hammer. Whenever a dwarf tries to wield this hammer in combat, however, it picks up and hurls the dwarf bodily at the opponent, at +3 to attack and 1d12+3 points of damage (to the dwarf-the opponent takes only 1d4 points of damage); the range is 60’. If the dwarf misses the opponent, the dwarf takes double the above damage; if the opponent has time to “set” or “ground” a weapon such as a spear or a military fork-well, it’s not a pretty picture. Incidentally, this hammer is an unusually handsome weapon, featuring the finest work of the elven master smiths.
