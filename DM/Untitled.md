Start with the visual. Rough age/gender/species/status is comprehensive, and you probably don't need all that for a very minor character. Let their brain fill it in.

Then go body language or personality traits. Finally, narrate their speech, if you're not confident with acting it out.

Body language is great for any NPC, and an outright description of personality traits is super useful to pin down a minor NPC or hammer in the true nature of a major NPC.

In general, I try to summarize personality in three words. You can use ideal/bond/flaw, but I just keep it open-ended. Here's an example of my [character log](https://icewind.quest/journal/trackers/characters/) from my Icewind Dale campaign, for example.

For important NPCs, I like to RP these qualities with show-don't-tell storytelling.

But for minor NPCs, I'll just show! Time is precious in the session, and I'd rather give the party a chance to quickly lock on to the character and progress. For example, 

> "The sergeant's tone is patient and understanding, yet ultimately you glean his loyalty lies with his duties. He says, <insert text with no voice required>."

For NPCs with a good deal of screen time, use body language. Facial expressions are easy to both mime and describe. Posture is a good one, and you can physically stand up to demonstrate and engage a table. Hands and feet position can be interesting too. Feet and stance, for example, often point towards a person's interest or away from their disinterest.

Lastly, I love voices. I think I do a good job with them, but yeah, I don't try to do it for everyone. Keep your good voices for good characters. Simply narrate or use a stock voice for everyone else.
