I'm of the school of thought that Auril should remain relatively hands-off until the players trespass on her by stealing the Codicil of White. However, I absolutely believe her presence should be felt earlier on.

-   On a clear night, a character may sight her Roc. Using a telescope or similar may have a character lock eyes with Auril and have a dreadful premonition.
    
-   For chapter 1, Ravisin, Vurnis, and Sephek can have their backstories and interactions further fleshed out and connected to one another. I also have them directly call out to Auril to seek her favor in battle. You can also make one or more of these returning villains.
    
-   For chapter 2, the Black Cabin already has cues in place for Auril's involvement. The Reghed Camp also looks perfect for some sort of barbaric ritual to conjure an avatar of Auril and foreshadow the Tests of the Frostmaiden.
    
-   I'm interested in whether people injected Auril's presence in Chapters 3 and 4. The Duergar subplot certainly draws the focus away from Auril for a bit.
    
-   Visions and dreams are a good way to display the themes of Auril tenets: Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, Preservation. These could be abstract visions or they could quite literally foreshadow the Tests of the Frostmaiden. I'm trying to have these four words appear several times earlier on, so the players latch onto their importance and begin to understand Auril. For example, I put them on runestones surrounding Vurnis's corpse in the Elven Tomb.


- Magic items on the theme of Auril's tenets? Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, Preservation.
