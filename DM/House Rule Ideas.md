- **Help requires proficiency.** Can’t use the ‘help’ action if you aren’t proficient in the skill you are ‘helping’ with.
- **Help action can trigger mishaps with profiency.** Both players roll a d20, if either of the dice pass the check then that’s okay. Otherwise, if the player helping does not have proficiency in the skill roll under 10, then a mishap occurs.
- **Haggling on prices.** You can only haggle is you're proficient in Persuasion.
- **Speak up to 10 words during combat.** Any more requires your action.

## Status Conditions
- **Dazed or Staggered, alternative to stunned.** See [this post](https://www.hipstersanddragons.com/dazed-alternative-condition-to-stunned/).
	- **Dazed**
		- A dazed creature cannot take reactions and has disadvantage on ability checks and Dexterity saving throws.

	- **Staggered**
		- A staggered creature’s movement is halved.
		- The creature cannot take reactions.
		- The creature has disadvantage on all d20 tests.

## Physical items
 - **Hotel bell.** A player may ring the bell to enforce DM fiat if there's a prolonged argument or discussion that's bogging down play.
 - **Torch bearer.** The DM may make everyone roll a CHA contest. The winner receives the torch, and the party's input and decisions are filtered through the leader to the DM.

## Combat tips
- Notify the next player when they're on deck. (This can be outsourced to a player or a tactician character)
- Pre-roll monster initiative orders.
- Give summons the same initiative order as the player. Consider rolling DC 10 to see if the summon is placed before or after the player on the summoning round.

## Character Creation guidelines
- **Your character has the desire to work with a team.**
- **Your character has a reason to adventure or put their life at risk.**
- **Your character fits within this world and setting.**
