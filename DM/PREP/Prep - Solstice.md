On Grimskalle:

- Reveal that the Eternal Rime is Divine Level teleportation spell, drawing hard on Auril's essence to bring IWD into the Plane of Ice. Reveal that IWD has sunk so deep between planes that they are unable to climb out of its "borders" with "conventional" teleportation magic.
- Boss fight with the Chosen of Preservation and Iskra. Her body has been used by Auril in a sort of advanced wild shape. She looks like Auril's first form, and in fact is the being riding on the roc. I've yet to decide on who to use for the character, but I doubt it matters much. Maybe Nalkara.
- The Chosen's death begins the true manifestation of Auril in this plane. The entire island will fall silent. A cold, spiraling funnel of frost will begin to creep down from the heavens. The party needs to escape.
- They may see flashes of imagery between the planes as they escape via skill challenges. For example: Hurtling blocks of ice, some of which pass right through them like illusions (they're still in the deep Frostfell) while others shatter and hurt (they're through the planar borders).
- Maybe a colossal vision of Auril will half-manifest as they reach Angajuk, and maybe she will be tackled by Umberlee, destroying the island. The party awakens on the shore, storms of winter blanketing the horizon.
