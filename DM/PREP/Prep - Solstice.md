On Grimskalle:

- Reveal that the Eternal Rime is Divine Level teleportation spell, drawing hard on Auril's essence to bring IWD into the Plane of Ice. Reveal that IWD has sunk so deep between planes that they are unable to climb out of its "borders" with "conventional" teleportation magic.
- Boss fight with the Chosen of Preservation and Iskra. Her body has been used by Auril in a sort of advanced wild shape. She looks like Auril's first form, and in fact is the being riding on the roc. I've yet to decide on who to use for the character, but I doubt it matters much. Maybe Nalkara.
- The Chosen's death begins the true manifestation of Auril in this plane. The entire island will fall silent. A cold, spiraling funnel of frost will begin to creep down from the heavens. The party needs to escape.
- They may see flashes of imagery between the planes as they escape via skill challenges. For example: Hurtling blocks of ice, some of which pass right through them like illusions (they're still in the deep Frostfell) while others shatter and hurt (they're through the planar borders).
- Maybe a colossal vision of Auril will half-manifest as they reach Angajuk, and maybe she will be tackled by Umberlee, destroying the island. The party awakens on the shore, storms of winter blanketing the horizon.




# Ostoria

**Ostoria** (meaning "**father's seat**" in [Jotun](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_language "Giant language")), also called **The Colossal Kingdom**, was the original kingdom of the [giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant "Giant").

As the kingdom grew, Annam split it up so that each of his favored children could acquire part of it and go on to found their own dynasties:

- [Vilmos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vilmos "Vilmos") received the seas and lakes, and would found the dynasty of the [storm giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Storm_giant "Storm giant").
- [Nicias](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nicias "Nicias") received the skies, and would found the dynasty of the [cloud giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cloud_giant "Cloud giant").
- [Ruk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ruk "Ruk") received the hills, and would found the dynasty of the [hill giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hill_giant "Hill giant").
- [Ottar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ottar "Ottar") received the northern tundras, and would found the [dynasty](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jhoth%C3%BBn "Jhothûn") of the [frost giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Frost_giant "Frost giant").
- [Masud](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Masud "Masud") received the southern volcanoes, and would found the dynasty of the [fire giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_giant "Fire giant").
- [Obadai](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Obadai "Obadai") received the caverns [below ground](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark "Underdark"), and would found the dynasty of the [stone giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_giant "Stone giant").
- [Lanaxis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lanaxis "Lanaxis"), the eldest, received the plains, and would found the dynasty of the titans. From him the capital of Ostoria would be built, known as [Voninheim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Voninheim "Voninheim").
  
  - The exception to this was [Arno and Julian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arno_and_Julian "Arno and Julian"), the two-headed runt of the All-Father's litter and the progenitor of [ettins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ettin "Ettin")


For much of Ostoria's history the resident giants competed among themselves to create practical and artistic wonders, each working in the unique manner of their kind. The hill giants for example, constructed a great stone circle which acted as both a calendar and oracle, casting shadows that took the forms of hunters and animals.[5] Though the greatest works of giant art and craftsmanship came from the stone and fire giants respectively.[8]

The cloud giants would construct castles[9] and immense floating cities within the clouds.[5][8] The stone and fire giants settled atop mountains and in the sprawling caverns beneath them.[8] The latter also tamed the volcanoes of the southern territories, building cities of adamantine and mithral. But the greatest of cities within Ostoria were constructed by the storm giants and titans, which featured mechanical conveyances and galleries housing artistic tributes to all of giantkind.[5] The storm giants also built great castles in the sky and mighty fortresses beneath the seas.[8]

In circa -28000 DR, Ostoria reached the peak of its power,[3] beginning the age known as the "Reign of Giants."

Two thousand years later began a war with the dragons. This war would last over a thousand years,[5][12] during which the giants were forced to throw aside their artistic pursuits, such as music and sculpture, in order to become more militaristic than ever.[5] By the war's end, the kingdom of Ostoria was reduced in size, losing all its southern territory to the dragons and became restricted to the north of Faerûn.

In -2550 DR, the death of the god Ulutiu caused a large region of Faerûn's north (present-day Pelvuria) to freeze, which led Ostoria to be slowly swallowed by the Great Glacier. 

Ulutiu, the Eternal Sleeper was in a state of voluntarily-induced slumber, not quite dead and alive enough to grant spells but floating unconscious through the Astral Plane. It was the necklace of The Lord in the Ice that created the Great Glacier when he sank himself beneath the Cold Ocean. While he had no prior disputes with them, both Auril and Umberlee had overlapping portfolios, so he would likely come into conflict with them if he were to wake.[1] Auril had also taken Ulutiu to her realm within the Deep Wilds[6] and was slowly siphoning power from him. This was not enough to wake him, but would continually weaken him to the point of death, at which point she could subsume his portfolio.

Ostoria ceased to exist 75 years later in -2475 DR with the deaths of most of Annam's sons, despite Lanaxis's efforts to save the kingdom.
