Queen Vassavicken. The giant queen herself was interred within a tomb of ice, set beneath the likeness of the [titan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") [Thrym](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thrym "Thrym"). Thrym was a titan[4] worshiped by the frost giants[1][4][2][5] as the giant god of cold and ice.[10][11] He was the de facto leader of the frost giants as well. Much later he fathered the Empyrean Nalkara with Auril, goddess of winter.

## Test of Endurance

After 12 hours, the Elk Tribe reach their new campground and set up camp. Any character who completes the journey with four or fewer levels of exhaustion passes the Test of Endurance. If a character gains more than one level of exhaustion on the march, it is reduced to a single level when they return to Grimskalle.
 “Auril’s emissaries have come! Come, warriors of
the Elk, let us show the Frostmaiden that we can endure
more than even her chosen servants!”

Each hour, roll 1d12 to see if there is a complication. On a roll of 1-6, use the complication listed below; on a roll of 7-12, there is no complication. If you roll the same result twice, you may treat it as no complication or reroll. Each complication affects the entire party.

**Icewind Dale March Complications**

1. **_Stragglers._** Some of the elk tribe are falling behind. Make a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) check to motivate them or a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to carry them until they can walk again.
2. **_Hail Storm._** The characters are caught in a sudden hail storm and must run for cover. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.
3. **_Rock Scramble._** The characters must climb down a treacherous rock shelf. Make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall 1d4 x 5 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.
4. **_Frozen River._** Make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross the ice safely. On a failed save, the character falls in. Another person can make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to pull them out, but the character gains one level of exhaustion.
5. **_Whiteout._** The blizzard grows more intense, reducing visibility to 10 feet. Make a DC 10 group Wisdom (Survival or Perception) check to stay on course, or become lost and add one hour of travel to the journey.
6. **_Stampede._** The characters startle a tribe of mountain goats, who stampede. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling or Survival) check to avoid getting caught in the charge. On a failed check, the character takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or get knocked prone and take an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

In addition to these complications, the characters must make forced march checks (Constitution saving throws) each hour from hour 9 to hour 12. On a failed saving throw, a character gains one level of exhaustion.

Any characters who fall behind or leave the march disappear into the blizzard and fail the test. They reappear in Grimskalle.
