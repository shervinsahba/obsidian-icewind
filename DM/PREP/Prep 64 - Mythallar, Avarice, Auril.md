### Thufeus's Journal

> 1. To whoever reads this─if there is anyone left to read it─let it be known that I, Thufeus, student of the House of the Arcane, bore witness to Ythryn's fall. The enclave's descent, the black doom which emerged from within, the sparks which spread across the horizon, turning night to day─it shall haunt me for the rest of my days. The engineers are still surveying the damage, but anyone with eyes can tell that the city is beyond repair. The surviving high wizards have been pleading with Iriolarthas, asking him to order a withdrawal. He knows our position is untenable, yet he refuses. “We will hold out the enclave to the last, for we are the lodestars of civilization itself─the Wizards of the Ebon Star,” he says. He is a brave, deathless man. Less so, we who serve under him.

> 2. Attempts to escape have been met with frustration and despair. Glacial ice blocks all conventional routes to freedom, and our magic is impotent against the enigmatic pulses coming from the spire. Some mysterious artifact within continues to pulse with energy, interfering with our spells and thwarting our escape. We have yet to receive reinforcements from the other enclaves... nor any contact. I fear none shall come. 

> 3. I've heard tales that Iriolarthas, by wisdom or desperation, in that dreadful moment of calamity, summoned a portal to a magical demiplane. He stepped through the rift, leaving the rest of us to face the impending disaster. Then all magic within Ythryn ceased to function, as if some malevolent force sought to drain it all away. Even Iriolarthas was expelled from his sanctuary and found himself trapped in the wreckage with the rest of us.

> 4. Iriolarthas remains steadfast in his decision and will suffer no talk of withdrawal. Frostbite nips at our fingertips, a painful reminder of our human mortality, and yet he has ordered us to continue searching for survivors, his spellbook, and his phylactery. I cannot shake the feeling that one of those matter far less to him than the others.

> 5. (shredded journal) ... I don’t feel safe in the observatory anymore.

## Iriolarthas's Study

Journal
> -339 DR. We have fallen. But we shall arise. Such is the will of the Wizards of the Ebon Star. Such is the might of Ythryn. Of Netheril.
> 
> -342 DR. It has been three years entombed in this ice. Though conditions have been dire, though no aid has been received, our research had persisted. The Ostorian Spindle may have undone us, but we will wait for our brothers. Karsus is on his path to divinity. Our salvation -- or at the least that of our future selves -- will come within the decade. And if he dawdles, well, we do close in on an alternative... Perhaps the Obelisk will recover our selves. Our future selves, I suppose. It has suffered fissures in the fall, but I see its promise. The etchings and undulations of chronomancy. If Karsus will not come, we will return to him. And we will do it right this time. In the meantime, we continue the search for my phylactery. The hunger has begun to gnaw, but we have ample time yet.

> -343 DR. Is it because we are godless? Because no one would defend us but ourselves? Is it because the gods fear our potential? But no—Karsus wouldn’t have failed. I knew it in my bones; I knew who Karsus was. This was another lie. He was betrayed—he had to be. But by whom? No mortal could have interfered; none possessed the power to disrupt his spell. No one except… Mystryl. I should have been there with you, my brother. I should have been cursed alongside you. I promised to stand by you every step of the way, and I failed. Forgive me, for I cannot forgive myself. Now, I am cursed to linger. 
> 
> -346 DR. My phylactery is lost, and I cannot sustain my form with souls. Soon, I will become a husk—a mindless shadow of the man I once was. I can feel it happening already. My mind frays, my purpose twists, and my rage grows. Is this truly our fate? To have our names remembered as symbols of hubris and greed? To be called arrogant and ignorant by those who cowered and fled? Our history tainted by cowards who dared not stand and fight? To perish here, forgotten? To have our work reduced to relics and ruins, plundered by lesser beings who reap the fruits of our blood and tears? I refuse to accept this. No coward will inherit the legacy of Netheril. The years we spent—the sacrifices we made—must not be squandered. Our 35 years of toil might be but a speck in their lifetimes, but it was half of ours. I will not let it end this way. Even if I become a husk of my former self, my will and my rage will endure. No god, no mortal, shall claim what we built. Ythryn will be our monument, our defiance. It will stand as proof of what higher humanity can achieve. Hear my vow: the legacy of Ythryn will not belong to cowards or scavengers. It will belong to those who are worthy—those who dare to grasp what we dared to build.


# Demiplane Time Chamber
There is a dial on the wall of the demiplane that adjusts time dilation; find notes of irio’s in his librarby
Time Dilation
1 hour in demiplane = 1 second outside
1 hour in demiplane = 1 minute outside
1 hour in demiplane = 1 hour outside
1 hour in demiplane = 60 hours outside
1 hour in demiplane = 3600 hours outside


# Mythallar
- It has been self-repairing over the centuries. By the time it healed, Iriolarthas's mind was long gone. Still he is attuned to it.
