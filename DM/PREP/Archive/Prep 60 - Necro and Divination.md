# Tower of Divination

Make the fight really easy, just the wizard and she gets wrecked in a single round. Then a loud booming voice says, "THIS FUTURE WILL NOT COME TO PASS" and the players are reset and the wizard has a few minions or environmental preparation to counter the strategy they use. eg a platform to stop the frontliners rushing in and some minions to keep the party occupied. This time the fight is a bit harder but not at boss level. Then when they kill him again (or he knows he can't win). "THIS FUTURE WILL NOT COME TO PASS" and the real boss fight starts with proper environmental effects/lair actions, minions etc. The players should have an idea that it's the last time (the wizard looks drained or all the valuables in the room have been sold). The players can turn the mechanic on the wizard and use things learnt in rounds 1 and 2 for better effect (wizard weakest saving throw or the minions weak to an element etc). Then you can finish with a fakeout "THIS FUTURE WILL NOT COME TO PASS" and the party reset to find the wizard fully drained of life or just mentally defeated, no fight here just a sad old man. If any PC fell in combat, this is a free resurrection that is totally in theme, no resources expended if they were smart enough to use them.
