# Tower of Divination

Make the fight really easy, just the wizard and she gets wrecked in a single round. Then a loud booming voice says, "THIS FUTURE WILL NOT COME TO PASS" and the players are reset and the wizard has a few minions or environmental preparation to counter the strategy they use. eg a platform to stop the frontliners rushing in and some minions to keep the party occupied. This time the fight is a bit harder but not at boss level. Then when they kill him again (or he knows he can't win). "THIS FUTURE WILL NOT COME TO PASS" and the real boss fight starts with proper environmental effects/lair actions, minions etc. The players should have an idea that it's the last time (the wizard looks drained or all the valuables in the room have been sold). The players can turn the mechanic on the wizard and use things learnt in rounds 1 and 2 for better effect (wizard weakest saving throw or the minions weak to an element etc). Then you can finish with a fakeout "THIS FUTURE WILL NOT COME TO PASS" and the party reset to find the wizard fully drained of life or just mentally defeated, no fight here just a sad old man. If any PC fell in combat, this is a free resurrection that is totally in theme, no resources expended if they were smart enough to use them.

# Music Hall

# Spire of Iriolarthas
- Force bridge is invisible Souls-like. Falling warps you over and over again through a loop
- Everlast acts as a magical force elevator, requiring a passcode to reach specific floors. EBONSTAR reaches the next level.
- Scroll of the Comet?

## Ballroom 
- Passed out revelers are actually shattered brains from the demilich screams
Replacement box text for entering the room with illusion up
> As the door swings open, you are met with a bedazzling sight. Murmurs of polite company and raucous laughter over elegant chamber music tickle your ears. A dozen noble courtiers fill the hall, bodies swaying in time to the music. Servants with sugared treats on silver platters maneuver a dance of their own as they duck and weave through the crowds with practiced ease. Seated patrons toast and drink to one another, their revelry neverending as the servants ensure no guest is left dry even a moment. 

Replacement box text for dispelling the room's enchantment:

> The room falls silent, colors flickering as guests turn in stop-motion to regard you with shock, before melting to the floor in a kalaidescope of colors that splinter and collapse in on itself. What remains is a ruined ballroom rimed in ice, its furniture jumbled and shattered. The crowds are gone, and what remains are three metal jars of human brain floating where courtiers were once dancing. They slow to a stop, and turn to face you, malevolence heavy despite their lack of facial expression.

# Mythallar
- It has been self-repairing over the centuries. By the time it healed, Iriolarthas's mind was long gone. Still he is attuned to it.

#  Obelisk, Spindle, and Fate of Netheril

# Avarice

Avarice's goal is along the lines of reaching the Spindle to break Levistus from his confines. 

- The barrier falls with Irio and Avarice knows this. Upon defeating the lich in his study, her forces march to the Mythallar. Perhaps the characters can have a dialogue via the high court balcony prior to what is likely a battle.
- Avarice is direct. She knows of the Rite, but is too cocky and proud to spy on the party. She meets the party at the barrier prior to their entering the tower... with overwhelming support. It's a trap. They can choose to fight or "co-operate." She will help them in the final battle _if_ they retrieve Irio's relics for her and allow her to attune to the Mythallar.

In either case, if the party has a short rest in the tower, Avarice will attune to the Mythallar causing _problems_.

- She might fly away mid-battle with the Black Swords, leaving the Levistus future open-ended.
- She might see it beneficial for Auril to be baited and struck down. The party doesn't necessarily need the Mythallar to fight Auril... Avarice will create these conditions (_two birds with one giant magical stone, she thinks_).
