# Spire of Iriolarthas

Y19A Main Entrance

> [!info] Flavortext
> Near the apex of the strut, the ceiling of the tunnel gives way to a landing that offers a view of the citadel’s uppermost reaches. Light from a high window illuminates a set of steps that ascend to a pair of oaken doors in the tower’s face.

> [!info] Flavor for the ballroom
> As the door swings open, you are met with a bedazzling sight. Murmurs of polite company and raucous laughter over elegant chamber music tickle your ears. A dozen noble courtiers fill the hall, bodies swaying in time to the music. Servants with sugared treats on silver platters maneuver a dance of their own as they duck and weave through the crowds with practiced ease. Seated patrons toast and drink to one another, their revelry neverending as the servants ensure no guest is left dry even a moment. 

> [!info] Flavor for disenchanted ballroom
> The room falls silent, colors flickering as guests turn in stop-motion to regard you with shock, before melting to the floor in a kalaidescope of colors that splinter and collapse in on itself. What remains is a ruined ballroom rimed in ice, its furniture jumbled and shattered. The crowds are gone, and what remains are three metal jars of human brain floating where courtiers were once dancing. They slow to a stop, and turn to face you, malevolence heavy despite their lack of facial expression.


## Force Bridge
- Force bridge is invisible, Souls-like. Falling warps you over and over again through a loop. 
- Everlast acts as a magical force elevator, requiring a passcode to reach specific floors. EBONSTAR reaches the next level.

# Mythallar
- It has been self-repairing over the centuries. By the time it healed, Iriolarthas's mind was long gone. Still he is attuned to it.

#  Obelisk, Spindle, and Fate of Netheril

# Avarice

Avarice's goal is along the lines of reaching the Spindle to break Levistus from his confines. 

- The barrier falls with Irio and Avarice knows this. Upon defeating the lich in his study, her forces march to the Mythallar. Perhaps the characters can have a dialogue via the high court balcony prior to what is likely a battle.
- Avarice is direct. She knows of the Rite, but is too cocky and proud to spy on the party. She meets the party at the barrier prior to their entering the tower... with overwhelming support. It's a trap. They can choose to fight or "co-operate." She will help them in the final battle _if_ they retrieve Irio's relics for her and allow her to attune to the Mythallar.

In either case, if the party has a short rest in the tower, Avarice will attune to the Mythallar causing _problems_.

- She might fly away mid-battle with the Black Swords, leaving the Levistus future open-ended.
- She might see it beneficial for Auril to be baited and struck down. The party doesn't necessarily need the Mythallar to fight Auril... Avarice will create these conditions (_two birds with one giant magical stone, she thinks_).
