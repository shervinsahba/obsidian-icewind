# Apius's Message

> I was High Diviner Apius once—before the chaos claimed me—and I remember when Ythryn first tore itself free of the earth. After Iriolarthas raised the city with the mythallar, he and his apprentices traveled north in search of relics of Ostoria, the ancient giant empire that warred with dragons before history learned to speak. Excavation after excavation failed, until at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice we uncovered a massive stone spindle carved with sigils none of us could truly comprehend, and we brought it back to Ythryn for study.

> During one of our experiments, the spindle answered us. There was a blinding flash and the mythallar shut down. The city began to fall. We had only moments to react as Ythryn plunged into the ice below, and as it fell, all magic unraveled as though something were siphoning it away. Spells collapsed and incantations died mid-breath.

> Some tried to flee, but the ice had sealed every mundane path, and magic offered no salvation. The spindle in Iriolarthas’s citadel continued to pulse, disrupting spellcasting and thwarting every escape. For fifty years that interference lingered, and in that long terror fear and isolation warped the surviving apprentices. By the time the pulses ceased, they were no longer mages, but nothics—twisted remnants of what Ythryn once was.

# Rite of the Octad
1. Hold a wand crafted from the Nether Oak over your heart.
2. Summon a flame in your palm.
3. Speak a secret about yourself aloud.
4. Compel another to share a secret with you.
5. Quench the flame in ice.
6. Mask your appearance.
7. Draw a circle on the ground using the ashes of a corpse.
8. Stand inside the circle and consume **poison**.

# Thufeus's Journal

> 1. To whoever reads this─if there is anyone left to read it─let it be known that I, Thufeus, student of the House of the Arcane, bore witness to Ythryn's fall. The enclave's descent, the black doom which emerged from within, the sparks which spread across the horizon, turning night to day─it shall haunt me for the rest of my days. The engineers are still surveying the damage, but anyone with eyes can tell that the city is beyond repair. The surviving high wizards have been pleading with Iriolarthas, asking him to order a withdrawal. He knows our position is untenable, yet he refuses. “We will hold out the enclave to the last, for we are the lodestars of civilization itself─the Wizards of the Ebon Star,” he says. He is a brave, deathless man. Less so, we who serve under him.

> 2. Attempts to escape have been met with frustration and despair. Glacial ice blocks all conventional routes to freedom, and our magic is impotent against the enigmatic pulses coming from the spire. Some mysterious artifact within continues to pulse with energy, interfering with our spells and thwarting our escape. We have yet to receive reinforcements from the other enclaves... nor any contact. I fear none shall come. 

> 3. I've heard tales that Iriolarthas, by wisdom or desperation, in that dreadful moment of calamity, summoned a portal to a magical demiplane. He stepped through the rift, leaving the rest of us to face the impending disaster. Then all magic within Ythryn ceased to function, as if some malevolent force sought to drain it all away. Even Iriolarthas was expelled from his sanctuary and found himself trapped in the wreckage with the rest of us.

> 4. Iriolarthas remains steadfast in his decision and will suffer no talk of withdrawal. Frostbite nips at our fingertips, a painful reminder of our human mortality, and yet he has ordered us to continue searching for survivors, his spellbook, and his phylactery. I cannot shake the feeling that one of those matter far less to him than the others.

> 5. (shredded journal) ... I don’t feel safe in the observatory anymore.

> [!info] Flavor for the ballroom
> As the door swings open, you are met with a bedazzling sight. Murmurs of polite company and raucous laughter over elegant chamber music tickle your ears. A dozen noble courtiers fill the hall, bodies swaying in time to the music. Servants with sugared treats on silver platters maneuver a dance of their own as they duck and weave through the crowds with practiced ease. Seated patrons toast and drink to one another, their revelry neverending as the servants ensure no guest is left dry even a moment. 

> [!info] Flavor for disenchanted ballroom
> The room falls silent, colors flickering as guests turn in stop-motion to regard you with shock, before melting to the floor in a kalaidescope of colors that splinter and collapse in on itself. What remains is a ruined ballroom rimed in ice, its furniture jumbled and shattered. The crowds are gone, and what remains are three metal jars of human brain floating where courtiers were once dancing. They slow to a stop, and turn to face you, malevolence heavy despite their lack of facial expression.

## Force Bridge
- Force bridge is invisible, Souls-like. Falling warps you over and over again through a loop. 
- Everlast acts as a magical force elevator, requiring a passcode to reach specific floors. EBONSTAR reaches the next level.

# Mythallar
- It has been self-repairing over the centuries. By the time it healed, Iriolarthas's mind was long gone. Still he is attuned to it.

#  Obelisk, Spindle, and Fate of Netheril

# Avarice

Avarice's goal is along the lines of reaching the Spindle to break Levistus from his confines. 

- The barrier falls with Irio and Avarice knows this. Upon defeating the lich in his study, her forces march to the Mythallar. Perhaps the characters can have a dialogue via the high court balcony prior to what is likely a battle.
- Avarice is direct. She knows of the Rite, but is too cocky and proud to spy on the party. She meets the party at the barrier prior to their entering the tower... with overwhelming support. It's a trap. They can choose to fight or "co-operate." She will help them in the final battle _if_ they retrieve Irio's relics for her and allow her to attune to the Mythallar.

In either case, if the party has a short rest in the tower, Avarice will attune to the Mythallar causing _problems_.

- She might fly away mid-battle with the Black Swords, leaving the Levistus future open-ended.
- She might see it beneficial for Auril to be baited and struck down. The party doesn't necessarily need the Mythallar to fight Auril... Avarice will create these conditions (_two birds with one giant magical stone, she thinks_).

Journal
> -339 DR. We have fallen. But we shall arise. Such is the will of the Wizards of the Ebon Star. Such is the might of Ythryn. Of Netheril.
> 
> -342 DR. It has been three years entombed in this ice. Though conditions have been dire, though no aid has been received, our research had persisted. The Ostorian Spindle may have undone us, but we will wait for our brothers. Karsus is on his path to divinity. Our salvation -- or at the least that of our future selves -- will come within the decade. And if he dawdles, well, we do close in on an alternative... Perhaps the Obelisk will recover our selves. Our future selves, I suppose. It has suffered fissures in the fall, but I see its promise. The etchings and undulations of chronomancy. If Karsus will not come, we will return to him. And we will do it right this time. In the meantime, we continue the search for my phylactery. The hunger has begun to gnaw, but we have ample time yet.

> -343 DR. Is it because we are godless? Because no one would defend us but ourselves? Is it because the gods fear our potential? But no—Karsus wouldn’t have failed. I knew it in my bones; I knew who Karsus was. This was another lie. He was betrayed—he had to be. But by whom? No mortal could have interfered; none possessed the power to disrupt his spell. No one except… Mystryl. I should have been there with you, my brother. I should have been cursed alongside you. I promised to stand by you every step of the way, and I failed. Forgive me, for I cannot forgive myself. Now, I am cursed to linger. 
> 
> -346 DR. My phylactery is lost, and I cannot sustain my form with souls. Soon, I will become a husk—a mindless shadow of the man I once was. I can feel it happening already. My mind frays, my purpose twists, and my rage grows. Is this truly our fate? To have our names remembered as symbols of hubris and greed? To be called arrogant and ignorant by those who cowered and fled? Our history tainted by cowards who dared not stand and fight? To perish here, forgotten? To have our work reduced to relics and ruins, plundered by lesser beings who reap the fruits of our blood and tears? I refuse to accept this. No coward will inherit the legacy of Netheril. The years we spent—the sacrifices we made—must not be squandered. Our 35 years of toil might be but a speck in their lifetimes, but it was half of ours. I will not let it end this way. Even if I become a husk of my former self, my will and my rage will endure. No god, no mortal, shall claim what we built. Ythryn will be our monument, our defiance. It will stand as proof of what higher humanity can achieve. Hear my vow: the legacy of Ythryn will not belong to cowards or scavengers. It will belong to those who are worthy—those who dare to grasp what we dared to build.
