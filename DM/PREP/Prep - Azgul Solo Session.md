# Flight to Solstice

Skytower Shelter’s griffons are safe to ride, but they are trained to return home after delivering the characters to their destination. Convincing a griffon to remain on Auril’s island while the characters explore the place requires a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, and even then, the griffon won't stay for more than 24 hours due to the unbearable cold.

# Trials of the Frostmaiden

**Endurance.** “Exist as long as you can, by whatever means you can. Only by enduring can you outlast your enemies.”

**Isolation.** “In solitude you can understand and harness your full potential. Depending on others makes you weak.”

**Preservation.** “Every flake of snow is unique, and that which is unique must be preserved.”

**Cruelty.** “Compassion makes you vulnerable. Let cruelty be the knife that keeps your enemies at bay.”

## Isolation

1. You put your hand to the ice wall and continue forward. There is no sound at all. Not even your footsteps crunch on the icy rime beneath your feet. You feel your way forward, slow or fast doesn’t matter, the walk seems to take forever. You breathe in the air. It is damp, and the cold gets into your very lungs. Suddenly you can feel the wall to your other side,. The passage is narrowing. The way forward gets thinner and thinner until you can barely get through. In the dark, in the silence, with your hands slipping on the ice wall that is your only guide, make a DC 15 CHA saving throw to continue!

2. You keep falling! The path has turned into a slalom in the dark! Water is flowing from somewhere, and you are washed down in the dark in a freezing rush! Make a DC 15 CHA saving throw to not panic! Skip to 3a if you fall over.

3. Eventually the rush levels out and you begin to have some control over your sliding fall. There is more water now and you are soaked. It is a bit warmer than you were expecting, and it smells of rotted eggs. But it is still pushing you down a dark and icy stream! Although you still cannot see, you realize you can hear again! And what you hear ahead is not good! A waterfall! There is no one to save you, no one to pull you out! You must do it on your own. Make a strength check to swim to the shore! DC 18 STR two tries allowed. If you pass you find the shore, make a strength check to haul yourself out of the rushing waters! DC 12 STR or go over.

	a.  If you make both checks – you pull yourself out and find the wall. You continue down a narrow icy lip that leads to a set of stairs that leads down. The sound of a waterfall is just off the path, and you wind your way until you reach a level surface in a room full of Frigid air and the sound of dripping water.

	b. If you go over – You are washed down and you begin to fall. You plunge into the pool of an ice cold lake! (Take ½ of 5d6 fall damage as you strike the unseen surface!) The cold of it takes your breath away ! CON DC 18 or exhaustion. You begin swimming in a random direction and eventually your limbs find an icy shore to cling to. You are now in what sounds like a large cavern with the sound of a fall behind you and the dripping of water all around.

4.  You stand in the cavern unsure of what direction to go when suddenly there is light! Not the gentle filtered light you would expect to find inside a glacier. But a Blasting, piercing, azure radiance that reveals a massive ice walled cave with a waterfall pouring from a crevice 50 feet up into a pool that fills part of the room. But that is not all, every surface of this room, from the lake to the floor to the many faceted walls is mirror smooth, and in every surface you see yourself, a thousand times over, from every angle, and the magic of the room begins. Please take this card and write on it an answer to the following question in some detail, “What facet of your character is your character most afraid of? And what would it look like if that facet was to dominate your character’s life and path, totally unhindered?” In the mirror of the ice, with no one else there to see, a version of you is played out just like what you wrote. It won’t stop, but you must try to find a way out before you freeze to death! Are you willing to bear looking at it to try to find a way out? Make a WIS DC 19 saving throw – You may try 4 times before an hour passes and you fail. (each fail is 15 minutes for frigid water effects)

Fail - After an hour of being unable to look so very deep into yourself, you find yourself back with your friends, your blue snowflake turns black and vanishes. Your exhaustion levels do NOT fade.

Pass – You pass the final test. You know you will never forget the visions you have seen of what lurks deep within you. But you succeed the test and through the strange and terrible vision, you see a passage. Passing through you find yourself returned standing among your friends in the Grimskalle fortress. The suddenness of finding yourself in the presence of others is jarring. You have had no time to process what you have just seen of yourself. In that moment, the eyes and presence of others is uncomfortable and you find yourself, perhaps just for an instant, wishing for a moment of solitude.


## Isolation in Ythryn

	You find yourself in a dusty, two-story study. This large chamber has lain undisturbed for centuries. On the upper level, all around you, are tables covered with wizardly paraphernalia. Staircases to the east and west descend to the lower part of the room, where a sunken library is situated in a twenty-foot-wide, ten-foot-deep circular pit. A ladder running along a circular track inside this hole allows easy access to the many books and scrolls on its shelves. Along the south wall is a single narrow window. Despite the the hundreds of books, devices, and nick knacks filling the study, you find the most striking feature to be that fact that you are alone.

	From the grimed window you see dark structures, latticed and connected, pulsing with deep purple light. You can discern an obsidian tower and a sixty-foot-tall obelisk of black stone, its surface covered in arcane runes, projects from the ground. A thin crack has formed on one side, stretching from the obelisk's base to its middle. The tower is shaped like an axe-blade... light shines from an upper window.

The character is in a demiplanar prison pocket of Ythryn, Iriolarthas's study. They are incorporeal, don't need to eat or sleep, and can't cast spells, but can affect their surroundings weakly as with mage hand. The books are all in Loross.

Have the PC describe what they do first. All escape attempts will fail. 

The days become weeks, monotonous and unchanging, then months, years, and decades. How are they feeling as the lonely hours stretch into days?

Over the course of their stay, the player makes a series of WIS and CHA saving throws, starting at DC
5 with the DC increasing by 5 for each success. Optionally, arcane casters and anyone who
spends multiple years studying Iriolarthas's library/equipment can make CON saves
instead, suffering symptoms of arcane blight. 

As an example, saving throws can occur at the end of the first day, week, month, year, decade, and then every 10 years. After each success or failure, the player narrates how the PC is feeling and what they get up to over the increasingly long intervals.

3 successes are needed to pass the Test of Isolation, but the PC also needs to accumulate 3
failures to escape.

Following their escape, the PC finds that despite only minutes passing in the real world, they
have aged 2d4 x 10 years (or a number of years that the DM determines to be appropriate for
character). At the DM's discretion, it would be appropriate to roll on the DMG Indefinite Madness
table following the PC's escape, or the player can decide how their time in isolation has
changed them.


## Endurance

	You find yourselves under the starry sky, in a dimly lit valley surrounded by mountains. Around you are Reghed tribe members wearing pelts of elk. A few shout, and you see all eyes between you and an aging weathered man. This is Jarund Elkheart.

	The Frostmaiden has been persecuting him. His heirs have been stolen by the winter. The stock of blue horn caribou grow thin. And they are chased by storm and blizzard. It is as if Auril wants them dead. 

	You are welcome to rest at their tribe. Several folk are fishing through ice pack. One pulls a knucklehead trout, and you feast.

	And then the ground cracks. The ground is a  frozen lake. The ice, once opaque, is now unusually clear, allowing you to see through it with hardly any distortion. A faint light glistens underneath you - a frozen sigil floats deep in the dark waters.

The characters are meant to dive into the water to reach the sigil. Have each character make six DC 20 CON saves as they swim down. Reduce by one or two if their swim speed is particularly fast. On each failure, they take 3d6 cold damage. A successful character will touch the sigil and be brought back to the
room. If they pass out in the water, they will need to be rescued by another player and brought
to the sigil. All characters are soaked after this experience unless they manage to prevent this in
some way. A character who is unconscious will float upwards and require death saving throws
while in the water. An unconscious character will not be able to pass the test.

## Cruelty

	You find yourselves in a large frozen room, the walls of which are lined with knives of varying sizes and shapes. There is one door. The image of the Frost Maiden is carved out from the ice, displaying her owl-like face and large, curved horns. The only notable thing is that an eye seems to be missing from the statue. Otherwise, the door does not seem to have an obvious lock, or even a handle.
  
## Preservation
- [[Dougan's Hole]] is being sacked by the Wolf Tribe.

Need to identify the important prisoner, [[Aerix]], and avoid [[Isarr Kronenstrom]]. Flee across the Redwaters. Fight two goblins and three tribal warriors and one bugbears.
