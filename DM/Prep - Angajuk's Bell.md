Greetings, operative. My name is Varrin Axebreaker. We of Clan Axebreaker have located wealth stolen from us many years ago. It is, unfortunately, sealed in a vault that’s magically locked. If you can recover the key—whatever it is—you’ll gain the undying gratitude of Clan Axebreaker. And I’ll cut you in for a percentage of the recovered treasure, of course. 

A prisoner incarcerated within the prison Revel’s End knows how to access the vault. This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you travel to the prison, infiltrate it, and learn how to access the treasure from the prisoner. 

Our contact in Neverwinter will field your questions, including whether you'd prefer to travel by sea or over the Spine? We could arrange for your passage with the merchant caravan known as the Luskan Deliverers, as land travel seems safest with this infernal winter.

Varrin, Stonesworn of Clan Axebreaker.


Varrin retrieves a faceted sapphire the size of a small orange and places it on the table. He waves his hand over the gem, and a glowing blue image of a building floor plan appears in the air above it. He taps the gem, and the image vanishes. The sapphire splits into sections, and he passes one fragment to each of you. The fragment grows warm in your hand, melts, then vanishes, leaving a warm, tingling sensation behind. “Think about the map of Revel’s End, and you’ll be able to see it.”
