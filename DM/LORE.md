- Auril was once Queen of Stygia, in the before times. They will learn of this in the Codicil of White. She still holds power there.
- Levistus's tomb is her work, sanctioned by Asmodeus. It's the Eternal Rime.
- The Eternal Rime is magic that encloses a region by drawing into the Plane of Ice.
- Auril was cast out by the Gods of Fury. Desperate and dangerous, she's encasing IWD with the Eternal Rime in order to enter the Plane of Ice and attempt to takeover the domain of ice itself.
- Levistus wants control over his realm and freedom. Perhaps that means Auril's spark.
- Asmodeus wants to watch Levistus fail. He enjoys it. He'll gladly take rewards along the way. The duergar was him toying with both Auril and Levistus, heightening their struggles. Hoping for opportunity to step in and take the rewards with no effort.


# Dawn

I'm letting Dawn on the Material Plane be a manifestation of Lathander's grace. It coincides often with sunrise, but is very much its own ripple within the Weave that relights the fire within dormant magical items wherever his influence is felt.

While the skies are blotted out in Icewind Dale, the power of the Morninglord is still present. The party experiences this during the Black Cabin quest.

That being said, I'm also running the eternal winter spell as a dangerous attempt by Auril to shift Icewind Dale into the boundaries of the Plane of Ice, where she can hide away from the world in a snowglobe prison of her own.

As IWD descends through the boundaries, Lathander's Dawn diminishes. On various milestones the +10 temp HP from Lathander's blessing has been decreasing. The party has just hit +0 upon entering the Caves of Hunger. Soon, perhaps, their items will no longer recharge.

They've wondered why I've given them so many gifts >:)

Of course, I hear the ancient Netherese are good with magic... so maybe they'll find a fix within Ythryn. They have a somewhat functional Summer Star on their person. And, of course, there is the Mythallar.

I have some other ideas to expand this lore from Lathander back through a past life as Aumantor alongside Mystryl, but I think you get the gist.
