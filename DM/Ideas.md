# Raw ideas
- Visions and dreams are a good way to display the themes of Auril tenets: Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, Preservation. These could be abstract visions or they could quite literally foreshadow the Tests of the Frostmaiden.
- Magic items on the theme of the Frostmaiden's tenets: Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, and Preservation.
- Isolation, Cruelty, and Endurance are initialized as ICE! Preservation adds in what she wants from the ICE with the Rime.
- Chapter 2: Vaelish was jailed for a plot to overthrow Ten Towns. That sounds like Zhentarim dealings. Perhaps he had an alliance with Naerth. A jailbreaked Vaelish could be welcomed back into the Zhentarim fold. Alternatively, perhaps Vaelish overstepped his bounds, and Naerth arranged for his arrest. In any case, he could be useful for campaigns that emphasize the Zhentarim.
- Chapter 2: The Reghed Camp also looks perfect for some sort of barbaric ritual to conjure an avatar of Auril and foreshadow the Tests of the Frostmaiden.
