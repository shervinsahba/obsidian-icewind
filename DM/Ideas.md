# Raw ideas

1.) I'm planning on introducing some Reghed traders in Caer-Konig for the Chapter 1 quest The Unseen. In short, the townsfolk will blame the Reghed tribesmen, adding some misdirection and creating some tension to resolve.

The Reghed will very much be outsiders - a society mostly separate from the Dalefolk. Yet, they're still human, and they're not entirely uncommon in Ten Towns. Trade and the survival does bridge the societies.

Trovus will vouch for the Reghed traders. He's been drinking with them. Hell, the tribesmen _brought him_ liquor. But, this of course might make Trovus seem like an unreliable source.

I haven't decided what tribe they'll represent, though.

2.) I'm also thinking about incorporating Reghed before and after Destruction's Light. To seed this, I may increase the number of Reghed in Ten Towns as players wrap up Chapter 2. These would be migrants, essentially, coming to the towns for a new life, as the eternal winter has made their nomadic ways untenable. For some tribesmen, this would be a mark of shame. In any case, this refugee population will occupy the Speakers and increase tentions in Ten Towns. For Destruction's Light, the Reghed will be present. Perhaps their actions will cause the societies to band together. Or perhaps not.

Along the way to Sunblight, I may have the players come across a Reghed Camp, just to give some more face time to the nomads leading up to these events.

3.) I really want to do a Twenty Stones of Thruun summoning. [Canonically, Isarr Kronenstrom wanted to achieve that](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Twenty_Stones_of_Thruun). But adding Thruun would be its own arc and need more thought.


## Overarching

- Visions and dreams are a good way to display the themes of Auril tenets: Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, Preservation. These could be abstract visions or they could quite literally foreshadow the Tests of the Frostmaiden.
- Magic items on the theme of the Frostmaiden's tenets: Cruelty, Endurance, Isolation, and Preservation.
- Isolation, Cruelty, and Endurance are initialized as ICE! Preservation adds in what she wants from the ICE with the Rime.

## Chapter 2
- Arveiturace is the progenitor of Auril's four tenets and scoff at the little devil.
- Oya hugs Oona and boops Hazel, recognizing her for whom she was.
- Angajuk might need help against sahuagin.
- Vaelish was jailed for a plot to overthrow Ten Towns. That sounds like Zhentarim dealings. Perhaps he had an alliance with Naerth. A jailbreaked Vaelish could be welcomed back into the Zhentarim fold. Alternatively, perhaps Vaelish overstepped his bounds, and Naerth arranged for his arrest. In any case, he could be useful for campaigns that emphasize the Zhentarim.
- The Reghed Camp also looks perfect for some sort of barbaric ritual to conjure an avatar of Auril and foreshadow the Tests of the Frostmaiden.

# Arcane Brotherhood

By ExcelLynt: because of her pet necromancer background, I gave Vellynne a custom spell to handwave how Animate Dead works with regards to how normally you'd need to cast animate dead every day to create and maincain control of them, which is inconvenient when you need to maintain 8 zombie sled dogs. It hasn't actually come up at the table but she has Animate Pet (name pending) and once cast, they stay docile as long as they're within like, 300 feet of her, since the "timer" for them doesn't count down as long as they know their master is near. The spell is under review with the Arcane Brotherhood and once her research and the spell published and credited under her name, no one else can learn it 😛


By Cptn_BIll: 
**Avarice in Ythryn:** Avarice still has 20 Cult Fanatics when she enters Ythryn but she now also has 5 Warlock of the Fiend (Volo) that will each lead a group of 5 fanatics as search parties. Those Warlocks have the following changes: they are 9th level spellcasters instead of 17th so they don’t have any 1/day spells and only 2 spell slots of 5th level. I will upgrade their spell DC to 16 though. The total CR of one encounter with a search party should be 16. 

A battle with Avarice will involve her, two gargoyles and an Ice Devil, either sent by Levistus to help her or from the Tower of Conjuration (Expanded Ythryn Towers). I would lvl her up to 11th level spellcaster, give her Chain Lightning or Contingency (or both) and raise her spell DC to 16 (18 Int, Duh).  A battle with her (now CR9), the devil and the gargoyles will have a total CR of 27.

**Dzaan in Ythryn:** Dzaan will have created a small army of illusions thanks to the Rune Chamber in the Lost Spire. When he arrives in Ythryn he will have under his command 3 Tlincalli and 9 Blue Guard Drakes (Volo) that he will split into three search parties with the focus of bringing him anything of value they find. An encounter with such a party clocks in at CR 11. He will also have the illusion of a Young Blue Dragon he made real to help him control his desert dwelling force. He will have made real all supplies and gear necessary for his force to reach Ythryn via his illusions. As for him, he could use the Chain Lightning Stadium as his base of operation and even completely replace the Magen team from the encounter (Dzaan + Krintaas + Blue Dragon + 3 Tlincalli). I would also level him up to a 10th level wizard with the Illusory Self feature in the PHB and give him at least 75 hp. I would also increase his INT to 18, raise his spellcasting DC to 16 and completely revamps his spell list with stuff like Major Image, Creation, Phantasmal Killer, Mirror Image, etc. All these changes will raise his CR to 7 so an encounter against him, the blue dragon and Krintaas has a total CR of 19.

# Levistwist
- [Levistwist where Auril was a former devil](https://old.reddit.com/r/Forgotten_Realms/comments/1767wix/what_would_the_repercussions_of_releasing/k4kndgj/)

What would be the repercussions of releasing Levistus?

Short answer is: not much. What I mean is that Levistus is already lord of the fifth and while he wants to be freed above all else, he doesn't realize that being free also means more vulnerable. The enemies he made over the milenia who couldn't reach him now can, and he will quickly realize the ambitions he has, the same ambitions than any other devil has, to improve his status are still as out of reach as they were, but now he has to worry about his own safety. So basically, his freedom achieved nothing except his own mobility at the cost of vulnerability, and the status quo of Baator remains.

So that leaves Asmodeus, the one who imprisoned him, and how he will react. Well in my game that is actually his plan, he wants Levistus to be freed. And as you might expect, the reasons are part of a design that goes back ages. It starts with Levistus trying to bring Benzozia (the consort of Asmodeus) to his side, and as a result she died and Levistus was imprisoned and lost his lordship of Stygia, according to everyone at least. The truth is that Levistus completely failed to manipulate Benzozia, she told Asmodeus, Asmodeus saw an opportunity, killed her himself and put the blame of Levistus. He then made a deal with an upcoming devil of Stygia, a baroness of Hell with powerful ice-manipulation talents, named Auril.

That's right, in my game the Goddess of Winter Auril used to be a devil, and ascended during the Dawn Age thanks to her help against the primordials where she defeated her rival Dur Baagal. That was made possible with the powers Asmodeus granted her, using the soul of Benzozia. In exchange, she simply had to create the ice prison that would be the jail of Levistus, if the prison ever failed then she would have to give her powers back to Asmodeus. But we now know something Auril could not have predicted then, that she became a goddess since, something Asmodeus predicted. And as a result, should a group of adventurers free Levistus, Auril would give her powers back to Asmodeus, which now include godhood (in my game Asmodeus hasn't ascended yet, but even if he did more power the better right?).

So Asmodeus is now near the end of a 30000 years secret plan to free Levistus, even though everyone think he wants the opposite. Which is why Auril has been sending waves after waves of servants against the party and they have no idea why, because if they succeed she loses everything. And that is also why some unknown devils and cultist have been seemingly helping them, those are servants of Asmodeus who are bound to not help the party free Levistus, but can absolutely stop the Aurilites as best they can.

In my mind, Asmodeus would never let Levistus be freed if he didn't want to, so I had to find a reason why it would actually benefit him instead, but so that he couldn't just do it himself either.
