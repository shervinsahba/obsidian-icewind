My own pet story for Dzaan was that he wanted to erase himself and live a new life. Knowing about the illusionists of Ythryn, he set out to expand his knowledge. He didn't expect to find the answer in the Lost Spire!

Background.
- Dzaan used his status as a former Red Wizard to be accepted into the Brotherhood. But why invite a malicious Thayan?
- Because Dzaan was in exile. He found refuge within the Brotherhood but couldn't escape his past.

How did Dzaan possibly get caught for murder?
- Dzaan's party had a mole, a Black Swords cultist. The players may learn this and **deduce** that either A) Dzaan discovers the mole and murders the party himself, or B) Avarice frames him, thinking he's found Ythryn proper, and kills off the adventurers.
- In either case, it **appears** the Black Swords set him up, surprising a resting Dzaan with the authorities. His execution follows.

Twist. The deduction is incorrect. The true Dzaan lives, and he is the one who framed himself.

- Dzaan was aware of the mole all along. While annoying at first, after the discovery of the Spire, it delighted him. He began to weave his own death.
- A first simulacrum was given life. He conspired with his duplicate to deal with the mole, sending his duplicate to Easthaven with the party. While the new Dzaan rests, the original betrays him, murdering the party and sparking his own execution. "Dzaan is dead!"
- The second simulacrum is the one we meet. It lacks free will and is unable to speak of his plan. The simulacrum serves as a record of Dzaan's last days, providing his own alibi for future wizarding adventurers who may come across him.

And thus the true Dzaan is waiting for his next adventure. Or perhaps he disappears into Icewind Dale, like many other lost souls.
