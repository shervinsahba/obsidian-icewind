## My Brew

**Frost Giant's Greataxe**
Hugely Heavy, Martial, Two-handed

Deals 3d12 slashing damage. Looks cool as hell.

_Hugely Heavy._ The wielder must be size Medium or larger to hold the giant greataxe. Creatures size Medium or Large roll with disadvantage. If the wielder's Strength score is less than 20, attacker must pass a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

**Sword of the Pact Keeper**
Rod of the Pact Keeper +1 and Longsword +1. Might augment down the line. A nice Levistus feature may be a Symbol of Pain that tortures the recipient, granting adv to Intimidation/Persuasion. It'd also surely piss off the "good" party members.

## Other Homebrew

+1 Studded Leather armor made from blink dog skin, inset with blink dog teeth. Allows the wearer to use _Misty Step_ once or twice a day.


+1 club that's just a frozen knucklehead trout


## WotC

_Nature's Mantle_ (from Tasha's) made out of crag cat hide.
