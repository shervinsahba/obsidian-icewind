## All or Nothing Coin
Wondrous Item, uncommon

On a roll you would normally use a d20, flip a coin instead. Heads is a critical success (NAT20), tails is a critical fail (NAT1). Can be used twice per short rest.

## Sword of the Pact Keeper
Rod of the Pact Keeper +1 and Longsword +1. Might augment down the line. A nice Levistus feature may be a Symbol of Pain that tortures the recipient, granting adv to Intimidation/Persuasion. It'd also surely piss off the "good" party members.

## Blink Dog Armor
+1 Studded Leather armor made from blink dog skin, inset with blink dog teeth. Allows the wearer to use _Misty Step_ once or twice a day.

## Frozen Knucklehead
+1 club that's just a frozen knucklehead trout

## Scrimshaw Jawbone
Wondrous Item, uncommon

This jawbone has been delicately carved with runic patterns that glow faintly blue in darkness. When worn or held in a hand, this talisman can temporarily grant an ally the benefits of stone skin.

When a creature within 30ft of you suffers a critical hit, you can reduce it to a normal hit.

This ability can only be used once per Long Rest.
