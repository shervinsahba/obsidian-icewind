I am Sloopadoop, a Kua-Toa fishman. Surprised by my intellect? I am part of the Society of Brilliance. We are small in number, and rarely stay in one place for long. My colleagues and I are working to improve the conditions in the Underdark. This not need be such a hostile place. Our goal was to study the Underdark, hoping to gain a better understanding about the terrain where they lived. 

Alas, my colleague and I were captured by the Sunblight duergar. I feigned stupidity and hid amongst the slurry from their mining activities. My companion, unfortunately, was left behind.
