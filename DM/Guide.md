Start in Bryn Shander. Railroad your party onto the west side of Ten Towns, introduce Vellynne after A Beautiful Mine and then draw the party to the eastern towns.

Vellynne Harpell can be easily introduced after A Beautiful Mine. Termalaine's speaker, [[Oarus Masthew]] is already short on funds in trying to keep his position and hold the mining town together after kobold and grell incidents in the mine. Thus, while the mine quest is offered by Oarus, the benefactor funding the enterprise is Vellynne. This tracks with the Harpell family fortune. When your players clear the gem mine, have Oarus offer them room and board for the night while he inspects the mine the next morning before delivering payment. What players don't realize is that Vellynne accompanies Oarus on this visit, searching the mine for any clues of Netherese artifacts. Oarus, of course, does not know Vellynne's true intentions, but may note that she seemed disappointed, as if she was searching for something and insisted they investigate to the bottom-most layer of the mine. If your party slayed any kobolds, Vellynne has since resurrected them. These are her undead kobold minions that the book presents. When your party meets Oarus in the morning, Vellynne may be present or may be walking away from Oarus as your party approach, giving a nod of recognition to the adventurers for clearing the mine. If confronted, Vellynne thanks the party for their efforts (and for her new minions). When pressed, she might note she is loading up her sled to head towards [[Easthaven]], hearing rumors that [[Dzaan]] is in over his head. She is looking to capitalize on his predicament, aiding her colleague in return for knowledge of Dzaan's recent discovery of the Netherese spindle. it's up to you whether she gleans any information, but this sets up Vellynne as a neutral party that may be encountered at Dzaan's demise in Easthaven.



I split chapter 1 into a west and east arc. If I were to run it again and faster:

__West (Bryn through Lonelywood)__ Run Cold Hearted Killer. It pairs well with ideas that (a) Sephek's body was that of a sailor aboard the Dark Duchess and (b) Sephek is posessed by the frost druid Vurnis's spirit.

- Cold Hearted Killer: Start in a big town like Bryn, forego using Hiln and just have Sherriff Markham/Duvessa give the quest to establish a relationship.
- Run a starter quest like Foaming Mugs or Mountain Climb, both of which lean into arctic exploration. Have the relevant NPCs inform the party about Torg's caravan to move along Cold Hearted Killer after.
- Have them come across an awakened animal during the previous quest, to learn some frost druid lore and foreshadow the White Moose.
- Run the White Moose and Sephek either on the way or soon after. Sephek and Ravisin can be mini-bosses, the idea being that Sephek is possessed by Ravisin's dead sister. Emphasize how they embody Auril's tenets for lore: Isolation, Cruelty, Preservation, Endurance to set up Ch5. 


__East (Easthaven and the Caers)__ Expose the Duergar threat and get acquainted with the Arcane Brotherhood.

Give them reknown and a hook to head to Easthaven or the Caers. You could introduce Vellynne here in the East as a patron or a person of intrigue and have her appear again the West towns, maybe around the time they meet Dzaan or Avarice.

- Burning Dzaan is a great segue into Ch2 Lost Spire.
- The Unseen and the Easthaven ferry setup the Duergar in Ch3.
- Black Swords introduces Avarice unless you do it elsewhere.

You should get a vibe for what Ch2 quests you want then. Black Cabin and Lost Spire are both very thematic.
