Here is a nice list of [consumable items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cscj9c_eSElaxskotQoHCRfnh26J5PID4AQz09Qjw0E/edit#gid=0) by rarity. The goal here is to create a list of items that humanoid enemies might have in their pockets or on their belt to up the level of combat. If on their belt, a high enough Passive Perception or an active check may notice the item while a followup Arcana check would possibly identify it.

3. Elemental Gem (A: Conjure Wind Elemental)
