## LOW TIER

- Boots of Speed - rare, the disadvantage on opportunity attacks is probably the thing here, likely only take this if you didn't let me take other ones.
- Decanter of Endless Water (I've secretly had this in my inventory since the beginning because I thought it was interesting) - uncommon, I guess in theory could be game breaking if pair correctly with Shape Water? but really serves no in game purpose
- Goggles of the Night - uncommon, we probably already have enough glowing items that this become unnessesary, but the cure to my non-darkvision.
- Lantern of Revealing - uncommon, kinda cheating becasue we know duergars can be invisible, but really only helps in that situation
- Ring of Mind Shielding - uncommon, to be honest, not that helpful, but love I could buy a ring with someone elses soul potentially trapped in it and I can't not hear them speak to me
- Ring of Warmth - uncommon, we haven't really been faced with cold damage, but might help with the new survival rules you have coming
- Periapt of Wound Closure - uncommon, just trying to keep our only healer from not dying to detath rolls

## MID TIER to "EH MAYBE TOO MUCH" - probably should have split them up
- Belt of Dwarvenkind - rare, might be more OP, but growing a full beard at dawn is worth breaking the game for
- Boots of the Winterlands - uncommon, very specific to this campaign obviously, but maybe more likely they would exist in this area and be available in the shop
- Driftglobe - uncommon, we probably already have enough glowing items that this become unnessesary, but the cure to my non-darkvision. also probably helps in a caved/fortress duergar battle...
- Ring of Free Action - rare, might come in handy out in the snow
- Ring of Shooting Stars - very rare, very on brand for my character though, realistically it just gives me more spells
- Robe of Stars - very rare, again, very on brand, and hella magic missile
- Sentinel Sheild - uncommon, like that advantage on initiative for someone with +0 DEX
- Stone of Good Luck - uncommon, +1 to checks is kinda a lot if you think about it though...
- Weapon of Warning - uncommon, can't be SURPRISED!, would help with survival in dungeons to try and sleep with an alarm system

## MAXIMUM (GAME BREAKING?) TIER
- Daern's (Darin's) Instant Fortress - rare, I want it.
- ing of Regeneration - very rare, free heals seems too much, but what if my tail gets chopped off?
- Rod of Alertness - very rare, like that advantage on initiative for someone with +0 DEX
- Staff of Healing - rare, always want those free heals
- Staff of the Woodlands - rare, honestly, the spells and "tree form" aren't that useful, what makes this OP is the +2 to spell attack rolls
- Tome of Understanding - very rare, "free" ability score modifier
