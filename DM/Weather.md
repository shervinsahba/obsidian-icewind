**Hex Flower.** Pick a hex to start in. Next, roll 2d6 and consult the key in the top right corner and move in that direction. If that takes you off the edge of the hex flower it loops around on the same row or column (the exception being edges that have an extra line which will stay the same hex until the next roll or arrows that indicate a the next hex).


>[!Danger] DM Note
> Consider increasing the DCs for the exhaustion check as the game progresses, expositing how the Rime worsens. During Chapter 1 consider having no check within Ten Towns, especially on the roads. Use DC 5 if you must or for a large party, and consider DC 10 for journeying into the nearby tundra, for example to Kelvin's Cairn. During Chapters 2-4, where tundra exploration begins use DC 10. On Solstice during Chapter 5, increase the check to DC 12. If they steal the Codicil, increase the check to DC 14, which can persist through Chapter 6.
