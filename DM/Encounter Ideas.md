[100 ways to spice up combat](https://old.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/12fdtxn/100_things_that_make_combat_more_interesting/)
[Some RotF encounter ideas](https://old.reddit.com/r/rimeofthefrostmaiden/comments/11rgpru/what_are_some_unique_encounter_environments_for/), some of which I put below.

- Magical ice where once you move, you keep moving in that direction until you hit an obstacle.
- Big Chwingus.
- Hearts of Ice. A pair of frozen lovers, died out in cold escaping together. They are reaching for each other even in their freezing death. Bringing them together grants a charm.
- Invisible Mine. A few duergar mining a chardalyn deposit. High enough stealth and they don't notice you, otherwise they vanish (turn invisible) and run.
- Ice floes that are actually giant ice crabs. There is a shiny sword or item in the center, lodged in the head of one from a previous adventurer. It now acts as a lure.
- Frozen Assets. The party comes across a merchant, frozen under a damaged cart/sled. He clearly broke down and died out here. Has a potion/scroll in his left hand. In his right, a set of merchant's scales, with weights on one side. Merchants would use this to weigh out currency. Leaving a matching amount of currency opens the hand with the potion. Leaving more, grants two items (one falls out from his robes). Stealing the item causes a vengeful spirit to emerge and attack!
