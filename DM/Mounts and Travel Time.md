# Book Info
**Axe Beak.** An axe beakâ€™s splayed toes allow it to run across snow, and it can carry as much weight as a mule, 420 pounds. Axe beaks, if expertly trained, could pull 2100 pounds, but they're notoriously fickle and a bit mean. A domesticated axe beak can be purchased in Ten-Towns for 50 gp.

**Sled Dog.** A sled dog (use the wolf stat block) costs 50 gp and can pull 360 pounds. Sled dogs must take a short rest after pulling a sled for 1 hour; otherwise, they gain one level of exhaustion.

> [!tip]+ Carry Capacity and Pulling Strength
> Carrying capacity for a creature is 15 times their base Strength. A large creature or beast of burden can carry twice this amount. An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.
