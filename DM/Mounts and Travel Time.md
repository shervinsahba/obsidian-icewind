# Book Info
**Axe Beak.** An axe beakâ€™s splayed toes allow it to run across snow, and it can carry as much weight as a mule, 420 pounds. Axe beaks, if expertly trained, could pull 2100 pounds, but they're notoriously fickle and a bit mean. A domesticated axe beak can be purchased in Ten-Towns for 50 gp.

**Sled Dog.** A sled dog (use the wolf stat block) costs 50 gp and can pull 360 pounds. Sled dogs must take a short rest after pulling a sled for 1 hour; otherwise, they gain one level of exhaustion.

> [!tip]+ Carry Capacity and Pulling Strength
> Carrying capacity for a creature is 15 times their base Strength. A large creature or beast of burden can carry twice this amount. An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Notes: 
 - **Exhaustion.** At the given duration, if a short rest is not taken, the creatures suffer 3 levels of revised exhaustion (or 1 level of 5e exhaustion).
 - **Hauling, Axe Beaks.** Axe Beaks are not known to haul sleds or wagons due to their fickle and fiery nature. Significant training would be required. For reference, an axe beak's carrying capacity would be 420 lbs. Thus they are most commonly used for a single rider and small cargo.
 - **Hauling, Dogsleds.** All given speeds are for an assumed load of up to 720 lbs, the maximum hauling capacity of two dogs, typically a rider or two and light cargo. If hauling a greater load using more dogs, then use the speed and endurance statistics for a dogsled team with two fewer dogs.
 - **Mounted combat.** The agility of an Axe Beak lends itself to mounted combat, acting as if the rider was mounted on a horse. The dogsled is less flexible in this regard.
