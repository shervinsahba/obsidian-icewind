RotF has a lot going on between the different factions and subplots, and, well, a lot of it is not expanded on in the book! In conjunction with trimming town quests (or towns as a whole), you may want to consider which plotlines to embellish and which to tone down. 

They could all use embellishment, but that's how you'll end up on track for a 80+ session campaign, like me :D

In terms of plotlines...

- **Auril's Cult and the Rime**: The brutalness of Auril can be established by Cold-Hearted Killer and the quests at Dougan's Hole (awakened animal), Bremen (awakened animal), and Lonelywood (awakened animal, frost druid).

- **Survival of the Rime:** These are more vibe than plot. That is, they have fewer NPC delivery methods for plot than the above quests, not to say they are lesser! Targos (Mountain Climb), Bryn Shander (Foaming Mugs), Easthaven (Toil and Trouble).

- **Arcane Brotherhood**: They are your stepping stone to Netheril, and your most long-lived collaborators/antagonists/rivals. They are introduced via Easthaven (Dzaan) and Caer Dineval (Avarice). Note that both of these are eastern towns. I strongly suggest introducing Vellynne in this chapter as well, perhaps as a primary contact or questgiver.

- **Duergar Threat**:  Chapters 3 and 4 are its own arc, a side-story to the Rime plotline. Duergar are introduced in Easthaven (ferry battle), Caer Dineval (since they are the mutual enemy of the Black Swords), and Caer Konig (The Unseen). Yes, these are eastern towns again! 

- **Zhentarim**: They are early antagonists and the book will neglect them past the first chapter. That being said, they're super fun. Targos, Termalaine, Good Mead, and Easthaven hit upon them.
