See [this](https://reddit.com/r/Forgotten_Realms/comments/1767wix/what_would_the_repercussions_of_releasing/k4kndgj/) for my inspiration.

In short, we know Auril was divine during the Dawn War, but the roots of her divinity is murky. In this retelling, Auril was once in fact a powerful devil... and Asmodeus has her cornered into a Faustian bargain that has taken millenia to unfold.

Asmodeus gave Auril power, heightening her command over cold. Asmodeus, in return, only required that she encase Levistus in ice forever, else return all powers to him. Auril went on to aid the gods during the Dawn War and ascended to divinity. And this is the seed of Asmodeus's long con... for if Levistus is ever freed, Asmodeus subsumes Auril's divinity.

Interestingly this DM wasn't even running RotF!

To map it better into RotF, I have it that:

- Auril is desperate after the Second Sundering and her failure in Legacy of the Crystal Shard to expand her portfolio into the storms and seas, angering her former colleagues, the Gods of Fury. Thus she attempts to fulfill her Isolation by drawing IWD into the Plane of Ice via the eternal winter spell, weakening herself in the process of this gambit.
- Asmodeus is aware that the boundaries between planes are thinning and seizes his opportunity to hatch the plan above. He commands Levistus to position himself in IWD to tunnel Stygia through the Plane of Ice towards the Prime Material Plane. The Duergar are meant to destabilize the region, seeding the fear necessary for Levistus to act.
- Levistus fucking hates this. He opposes Asmodeus at every step. But he knows about Ythryn and the Ostorian Spindle, which he believes can free him. So he acts against the Duergar and commissions Avarice to break into Ythryn and use the Spindle's powers to free him.
- _Asmodeus totally knows Levistus is going to do that._ Yeah sure, go "free" yourself Levistus. Asmodeus is not threatened by this outcome. He only stands to benefit through Auril's spark as well command over the north.
- Auril, ever in isolation and being the force of nature that she is, only realizes the risks to her own divinity once Reghed Glacier cracks open.

What's kind of cool is that Auril's [former Chosen have actually used ice devils in the past](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iyraclea), so there's a precedent for this. The party will learn of this history upon reaching the Codicil... and noting how much of it is written in infernal.

The one issue of course... is that this leaves the outcome of the campaign rather bleak! I wonder how much of it we'll stick with as the game progresses. If we do stick with it: Do the heroes find a way to resolve it? Do we keep playing with Asmodeus in mind?? How will the Spindle be used??? No idea hahah, but it'll be fun.
