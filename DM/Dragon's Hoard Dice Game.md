**Terms:**

- **The Hoard**: The pot which represents the dragon’s hoard.
- **The Stash:** The amount of coins a player has accumulated during their turn.
- **Made a Meal:** Rolling a one. You’ve become the dragon’s dinner.
- **Trifecta:** Rolling any triples other than 111… a clean getaway.
- **Rogue's Gambit:** Risking one’s stash in an attempt to accumulate more.
- **Thief’s Escape:** Escaping with one’s stash in hand.
- **Full Belly**. If the player immediately preceding you was Made a Meal, the dragon has a full belly. If you roll a 1, your turn is _skipped_. Pass the dice to the next player on the right. You may try again if the dice return to you.

**Rules:**

1. A hoard is decided with all players paying into that hoard. The hoard should consist of many identical coins. Advice is for the pot to be 25 coins per player.
2. The first player is chosen at random or is the player to the right of the first player in the previous round. This player rolls 3d6:
    - If the result contains a 1, the player has been made a meal -- their stash returns to the hoard and play moves to the player to the right. Though the player has lost their stash, they are still in play should the game continue around the table back to them.
    - If the result is a Trifecta, the player collects the entire hoard and the round ends.
    - Else, the player successfully accumulates that many coins into their stash.
3. The player then makes a choice: Make a Gambit or take the Thief’s Getaway.
    - If the player chooses to **Rogue's Gambit**, they roll another 3d6 in an effort to accumulate more coins for their stash. This step can be repeated until the hoard is depleted, the player is made a meal, or they choose the Thief’s Getaway.
    - Taking the **Thief’s Escape** allows the player to pocket their accumulated stash. Those coins are no longer in play, they’ve successfully gotten away with those coins. Play passes to the player to the right.
4. Play ends once the hoard is depleted.
