In the first chapter of the book, the Zhentarim presence makes for great villainy. Naerth Maxildanarr seems to have been inspired by Vaelish Gant's failed attempt to undermine Ten Towns in *Legacy of the Crystal Shard*, and the Zhentarim's approach seems to be spreading quite well these past few years. Under Naerth's leadership:

- The Zhentarim have control over arguably the 2nd most important town in IWD. Targos is the a central economic hub of IWD, given that Lac Dinneshere's fishing industry has frozen over. It is one of the best fortified townships.
- The former speaker of Targos, Giandro Holfast, has been replaced by Naerth. This character is mentioned in *LotCS*. Giandro was a native to the city and a master shipwright for their dockworkers' guild. He has ostensibly been bought out by the Zhentarim, including many others in the fishing industry.
- The Harper presence has been considerably thinned out in the region. Only Warden Marta Marthannis of Revel's End and a character known only as Beldora in Bryn Shander are stated to be Harpers in RotFM.
- Skath is a Zhentarim merc leading a decently trained militia.
- Easthaven's Town Hall is known to be infiltrated by Zhent. Prudence triggers a possible theft of a rare magic cauldron, whose value is at least 5000gp.
- Good Mead's leadership is comprimised due to the Zhent's history with Shandar Froth.
- Termalaine's militia is "in cahoots" with Naerth and are looking to oust Speaker Masthew.

All this being said, the Zhentarim threats don't extend out of Ten Towns and thus don't have a presence in Chapter 2. Then comes Chapters 3-4, and the Duergar assault gives a good reason to put such scheming plots on permanent hold until the Rime is ended.
