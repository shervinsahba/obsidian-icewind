**Dzaan's Hired Party**. All four of these Easthaveners have been found dead. A list of names was anonymously provided to Captain Imdra Arlagath, along with a report that Dzaan - the _red wizard_ Dzaan - had murdered the lot. A surprise visit by the Easthaven guard to Dzaan's inn room lead to his capture and arrest. A red wizard's blade was indeed confiscated, though there was no characteristic robe. Record of the hired party and summaries of payments were also found in his room.

- Meryl Diane
- Hank Berrybore
- Gurth Miodal
- Faith

A history check or a tiefling player recognizes the final name in this list to likely be, well, that of a tiefling. At Caer Dineval, the Black Swords cultists have recently finished burying one of their dearest: a young tiefling girl. When pressed, they reveal her name to be Faith. Perhaps the party will find her journal in the castle if they look hard enough.
