Extra Comments and Spellbook: The Wizards in the module may have different opinions and points of view, but there is something common to them all, everyone of them has "Detect magic" in their spellbooks. Btw, no doubt Iriolarthas is a Demilich with their phylactery in their same plane: They hasn't got "imprisonment" in their spellbook!

Now, for the extra Spellbook, it doesn't appear in the module RAW, but I think it is an oversight:
