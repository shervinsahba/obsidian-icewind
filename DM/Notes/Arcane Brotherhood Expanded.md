1. Cashaan the Red, Archmage Arcane. Calishite human male. A powerful necromancer who came from Calimshan around 1485 DR to rebuild the Arcane Brotherhood. He's the boss.
2. Zelenn the White, Overwizard of the West. Nass's master. I know nothing else. Presumed female? Unknown race.
3. Jendrick the Blue, Overwizard of the South. Vaelish Gant's former master. I know nothing else. Presumed male? Unknown race.
4. Teyva the Gray, Overwizard of the East. Presumed male and no idea of race.
5. Druette the Raven, Overwizard of the North. Presumed female and no idea of race.

## Ghostdragon:
Most of this is from Legacy of the Crystal Shard Adventure.
1. The elf wizard Zelenn Essrenthir runs operations in Neverwinter. She lived there before the Spellplague and has a deep knowledge of the city’s past, if not its recent history. Many major players, particularly Lord Neverember, want to gain her confidence in the hope that she can help them secure their position in Neverwinter. But with the perspective that comes from living such a long life, Zelenn waits for the right time to use her influence to tip the balance in the Brotherhood’s favor. Not all members of the organization are so patient, though, and some have suggested that if Zelenn does not act soon, she should be replaced by someone who will.
2. Cashaan el Farid knows that quelling the chaos in Luskan is the first step in making the city a useful base again, since no trade will flow into the city until merchants can travel there without undue risk of loss (or violent death). To that end, he has started hiring adventurers to help clear out the worst elements. To keep the revival of the Brotherhood secret as long as possible, recruiting wizards usually pose as members of a more respectable organization or as dispossessed gentry with rights to property in the city. Cashaan el Farid is a human necromancer from Calimshan. Having grown up using his peoples’ fear and hatred of their genasi oppressors to weave his own subtle spell of control, Cashaan knows how to use desperation to his advantage—and Luskan is full of desperate people.
3. Teyva “Magehand” Lillowind. A half-elf thief and self-taught mage, her resourcefulness makes up for her meager arcane talent. She’s hoping to broker an alliance with Nine- Fingers Keene, her former superior at the head of Baldur’s Gate’s powerful thieves’ guild. Establishing a presence in Baldur's Gate wasn’t a challenge for the Brotherhood, but as the new player in an established pecking order of guilds and regional interests, the organization has been hard-pressed to expand its influence in the city.
4. Jendrick the Blue in Port Llast????
5. Druette "the Raven" in Waterdeep Druette “The Raven” Pentecost is a highly influential member of the Arcane Brotherhood, and the head of a respected Waterdhavian merchant guild. Although she appears to be a freckled, auburn haired 19 year old girl, in fact she is much older, as she uses her powerful transmutation magic to appear younger. She is a cold, calculating woman without an ounce of mirth in her, and she maintains that the Brotherhood is an organization of mages with an interest in improving trade in the North.

# Avarice
My take is that Avarice, regardless of the Black Swords being routed from the Caer, would continue to seek Netherese artifacts until it becomes apparent to her patron that the Codicil has opened Reghed Glacier and that the path to Ythryn has been discovered.

So, if you want to include more Avarice in the story, you can have her and her cronies tie into any quests involving the Netherese. They may seek the Lost Spire, the Shield Guardian at Karkolohk, or even look to shake down Macreadus at the Black Cabin. In the meantime, she may be scouting for information about Ten Towns, and even if she is an antagonist, the party run afoul of the Dalefolk if they pick a fight with her in a packed tavern.

Furthermore, she may be compelled by Levistus to act against the Duergar threat, if he realized Asmodeus is pulling their strings. That opens her up to more options, including opportunities to ally with her in Ch3-4.

One way I'm working these into my story is to have her act as a rival party, possibly picking off certain quests that my party didn't reach. For example, it's become clear that my group is targeting The Dark Duchess and Revel's End, sending them north. In the meantime, Avarice may have slaughtered the goblins in Karkolohk and claimed the Shield Guardian... as well as earned some clout among Ten Towns, who Speakers may both respect or be intimidated by her.
