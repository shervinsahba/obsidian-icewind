# Session Plan
The party has arrived as Revel's End. They introduced themselves


# NPCs
- Warden Marta Marthannis

## Prisoners
- Vaelish Gant
- Prisoner 13
- Edgin Darvis
- Holga Kilgore
- Spores druid who would grow several types of fungi in a cave under his cell, make drugs out of them, and sell them to some of the guards. Maybe he could either help your party to drug the guards or one of the fungi gives you the effect of the feign death spell when you eat it.

>[!note] Vaelish Gant
> Knows lore about Hedrun, the Ice Witch, Auril's former Chosen.
> Knows about Reghed Glacier.
> Naerth of all people had arranged for his arrest.
> Vellynne was denied a parlay with him by the warden.
> Avarice is considering breaking him out, using him, and discarding him when he's no longer needed.



# Prisoner 13 Materials

## Suspicion
Activities outside the daily routine of the prison draw attention from the guards and what few other staff members there are. Suspicion is measured in levels from 1 to 6. When the characters arrive at the prison, the suspicion level is 1. Suspicion can increase when prison staff members witness or and evidence of behavior outside the norm. Circumstances that increase the suspicion level include the following:
- Using a prisoner’s real name while in the guise of prison staff
- Getting caught by a patrol (see Patrol Routes)
- Casting a spell that has perceptible components or effects in sight of a guard
- Conversing with a prisoner about anything other than prison business (such as giving them instructions for tasks)
For suspicion to increase, prison staff members must witness the characters performing unusual activity, and any witnesses must report their observations. If the
characters can convince the witness what they saw was justified, the suspicion level doesn’t increase.

## Distractions
A character can create a distraction, giving themself or an ally time to undertake a suspicious activity without being witnessed. If the distracting character succeeds on a Charisma (Deception) check against a DC set by the current suspicion level (see the Suspicion table), the suspicious activity goes unnoticed. Use your discretion to decide if any given activity is subtle enough to be covered by a distraction. For example, a glib conversation can’t cover up an explosion.

| Level | Patrol Die | DC  |
| ----- | ---------- | --- |
| 1     | d20        | 10  |
| 2     | d12        | 12  |
| 3     | d10        | 14  |
| 4     | d8         | 16  |
| 5     | d6         | 18  |
| 6     | d4         | 20  |

- **Level**. The current suspicion level is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) every 8 hours if the prison staff detects no suspicious activity during that time.
- **Patrol Die**. Roll a die based on the current suspicion level when characters enter the patrol route to see if they encounter a guard patrol (see “Patrol Routes”).
- **DC**. The DC of Charisma checks made against prison staff and of ability checks made to avoid patrols is set by the current suspicion level.


## High Alert
When a matter of concern is brought to her attention, the warden (see area R21) decides whether to place the prison on high alert. Circumstances that warrant taking
such action include a prisoner revolt, an escape, the approach of an unfamiliar ship, a dragon sighting, an attack, discovering a dead body, or suspicious activity (see
“Suspicion” above). By speaking the command word, “maristo,” the warden—and only the warden—can place the prison on high alert (or speak it again to end the high alert), with the
following effects:
- **High-Alert Signals.** For 1 minute, a warning horn blares throughout the prison, and all light created by
continual flame spells in the prison takes on a reddish hue.
- **Prison Deployment.** The guards in area R19 don their armor, arm themselves, and move to area R18. The warden does the same and commands the garrison from there. Members of the Absolution Council retreat to area R20.
- **See Invisibility.** The warden and all prison guards gain the benefit of a
see invisibility spell.

## Patrol Routes
Guards regularly patrol in pairs from the guard rooms (area R3, alternating which room for each patrol) around the hexagon (area R15), with short checks into the
courtyard (area R11) and the armory (area R10). The route is marked in yellow on the players’ map of Revel’s End. It normally takes 4 minutes for a patrol to make its
round and return to its post.

When one or more characters enter an area marked on the patrol route, roll a die. The size of the die rolled is determined by the current suspicion level of the prison, as
indicated on the Suspicion table. On a 1, the characters encounter a patrol. Ask the players how their characters react, and give them 1 round of actions. The
characters can try to slip away if there is a nearby exit or corner to duck around by making a group Dexterity (Stealth) check or try to blend in by making a group
Charisma (Deception) check. Each check is made against a DC set by the current suspicion level. On a failure, the patrol notices the characters, who must account for
their presence.

If the characters try to talk their way past a patrol, have one of the characters make a Charisma check using Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion, depending on their
story, against a DC set by the suspicion level. If other characters support the story, the check is made with advantage. On a success, the patrol lets them go. On a
failure, the patrol escorts the characters to a guard room (area R3), where the guard interrogates the characters about the characters’ presence in a prohibited area. If
the characters have a cover story for being in the prison, the guards escort them to where they should be: the kitchen staff’s quarters (the largest side room off area
R8) or the barracks (area R19) in the case of off-duty guards. The suspicion level then increases by 1.

Once the characters encounter a patrol, don’t check for another patrol when the characters enter the route until 20 minutes have passed

They're housed where the Absolution Council members are located in the south east, and the prison will be under lockdown. This gives them several objectives:

- Retrieve their weapons
- Defend the council members / prison
- Finish loose ends with Vaelish or Prisoner 13
- Live

The guards will be outside the northwest armory - the opposite side - having cornered the "one blue slaad." Logically, the players will want their weapons. The absence of guards gives them the opportunity to lockpick the evidence chest in the guard room by the entrance where their weapons are located. This, of course, leads to the first attack:

- 1-2 red slaads

The slaads have already begun to multiply. The heroes could now have an opportunity to talk to prisoners and then assist guards who have the blue slaad "cornered." Announcements made by the warden will guide them there.

- 1 blue slaad

Once the party makes it out to the panopticon, it becomes known that prisoners are transforming and the ventilation system is compromised. The players should realize that their wounded characters are likely infected as well.

Lights go out, like the linked post above and doors will probably open soon after. They have a prison riot to content with. Amidst it, another combat will ensue. Prisoners are fighting other slaadi in the background or combating the guards. Anyway, the party faces

- 3 reds, 1 green*

The green slaad, seen through flickering lights, will flee after the first round into the vent. Messages by the warden will play every round. They will stop a round after the green slaad gets there. It is now a gray slaad, and the real warden is unconscious, stuffed in her closet with a teddy bear torso. The bear's head is on the floor. The gray slaad takes on the warden's appearance.

The players must ascend the central tower to apprehend the gray slaad, who will mess with them. The stairwells are littered with bodies. "It's on the roof! Hurry! I must secure the grounds!" says the warden.

Hopefully this leads to a showdown on the main floor.

- 1 gray slaad, x red slaads as needed

Maybe the self-destruct sequence is set off at some point, and they need to find the warden and convince her it's safe to deactivate it.
