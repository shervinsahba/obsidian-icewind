# False Hydra
- missing prisoners with existing records, pictures of them on the wall but an empty cell
- Vaelish has scratch marks on his arms, trying to subconsciously tell himself what happened.
- A note written in blood that says "It's Eating Us". 
- People have memory problems trying to remember 'where' Revels End even was and implied there's some kind of magical security shield that messes with people's memories, so it's harder to find for breakout attempts and so forth. This primed them knowing the prison just had strange stuff going on to keep it secret and secure.
- Use a deaf character! They know what's happening. Perhaps a bandaged person in the infirmary.
- Arveiturace attacks have happened. But the dragon has flown away.

# Prisoners
- Vaelish Gant
- Prisoner 13
- Edgin Darvis
- Holga Kilgore
- Spores druid who would grow several types of fungi in a cave under his cell, make drugs out of them, and sell them to some of the guards. Maybe he could either help your party to drug the guards or one of the fungi gives you the effect of the feign death spell when you eat it.




# Prisoner 13 Materials

## Suspicion
Activities outside the daily routine of the prison draw attention from the guards and what few other staff members there are. Suspicion is measured in levels from 1 to 6. When the characters arrive at the prison, the suspicion level is 1. Suspicion can increase when prison staff members witness or and evidence of behavior outside the norm. Circumstances that increase the suspicion level include the following:
- Using a prisoner’s real name while in the guise of prison staff
- Getting caught by a patrol (see Patrol Routes)
- Casting a spell that has perceptible components or effects in sight of a guard
- Conversing with a prisoner about anything other than prison business (such as giving them instructions for tasks)
For suspicion to increase, prison staff members must witness the characters performing unusual activity, and any witnesses must report their observations. If the
characters can convince the witness what they saw was justified, the suspicion level doesn’t increase.

## Distractions
A character can create a distraction, giving themself or an ally time to undertake a suspicious activity without being witnessed. If the distracting character succeeds on a Charisma (Deception) check against a DC set by the current suspicion level (see the Suspicion table), the suspicious activity goes unnoticed. Use your discretion to decide if any given activity is subtle enough to be covered by a distraction. For example, a glib conversation can’t cover up an explosion.

| Level | Patrol Die | DC  |
| ----- | ---------- | --- |
| 1     | d20        | 10  |
| 2     | d12        | 12  |
| 3     | d10        | 14  |
| 4     | d8         | 16  |
| 5     | d6         | 18  |
| 6     | d4         | 20  |

- **Level**. The current suspicion level is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) every 8 hours if the prison staff detects no suspicious activity during that time.
- **Patrol Die**. Roll a die based on the current suspicion level when characters enter the patrol route to see if they encounter a guard patrol (see “Patrol Routes”).
- **DC**. The DC of Charisma checks made against prison staff and of ability checks made to avoid patrols is set by the current suspicion level.
