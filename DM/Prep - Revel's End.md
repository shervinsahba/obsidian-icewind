# False Hydra
- missing prisoners with existing records, pictures of them on the wall but an empty cell
- Vaelish has scratch marks on his arms, trying to subconsciously tell himself what happened.
- A note written in blood that says "It's Eating Us". 
- People have memory problems trying to remember 'where' Revels End even was and implied there's some kind of magical security shield that messes with people's memories, so it's harder to find for breakout attempts and so forth. This primed them knowing the prison just had strange stuff going on to keep it secret and secure.
- Use a deaf character! They know what's happening. Perhaps a bandaged person in the infirmary.
- Arveiturace attacks have happened. But the dragon has flown away.

# Prisoners
- Vaelish Gant
- Prisoner 13
- Edgin Darvis
- Holga Kilgore
- Spores druid who would grow several types of fungi in a cave under his cell, make drugs out of them, and sell them to some of the guards. Maybe he could either help your party to drug the guards or one of the fungi gives you the effect of the feign death spell when you eat it.
