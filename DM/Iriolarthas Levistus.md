What do you think of this Levistus angle to Iriolarthas? My game is definitely featuring the prince of frost, and I did relay the Asmodeus aspect to the Duergar recently, which several players enjoyed. The question remains to how exactly I'll tie them together in the endgame, beyond the obvious Levistus wanting freedom from Asmodeus's prison.

Ultimately, this hinges on the roles of Ythryn and Auril, as well as the question of "who exactly is the BBEG?"
